Summary: My checklist of things to take for a triathlon

# üíß Hydration strategy on the bike

That's something that needs to be figured weeks in advance, in case additional equipment is required. Multiple things to consider:

- Grabbing bidons from volunteers at aid stations can be tricky, [bidons are hard to grab even at low speed](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIDstmxttmD).
- [Aero bidons](https://www.canyon.com/en-de/gear/accessories/bike-accessories/cycling-water-bottle/canyon-fuel-aero-bottle/9102280.html) are not necessarily a good idea since you cannot swap the bidons with standard bidons during the ride, if you run out of water. I believe they're only appropriate for olympic distance triathlons or shorter.
- Bidons can be stored in the frame (2 bidons maximum), between the aero bars (usually 1, sometimes 2 bidons) or behind the saddle (2 bidons maximum, maybe 3?).
- [Fully integrated hydration systems](https://www.canyon.com/en-de/gear/accessories/bike-accessories/cycling-water-bottle/canyon-speedmax-hydration-system/10014133.html) exist but the aero gain is very marginal, and those systems are expensive. Also, they need to be refilled, they cannot be swapped during the race like bidons.

Considering that it's hard to predict how much water one will drink, it's best to ensure to be able to swap empty bottles with new ones. Also, because of the difficulty of grabbing bottles, it's probably best to carry all the water/energy drinks one will need. Therefore, my recommendation would be to store two standards bidons in the frame, and one additional bottle behind the saddle for a 70.3. For a full IronMan, I'd probably consider 4 in total (2 in the frame, 2 behind the saddle). Trading empty bottles for full ones will always remain an option in case of hot weather.
