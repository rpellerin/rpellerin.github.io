Summary: My checklist of things to take for a triathlon

# üìÖ To change on the bike weeks ahead of the race

Make sure to ride a few times with the new gear.

- <input type="checkbox" /> New cleats
- <input type="checkbox" /> New brake pads
- <input type="checkbox" /> New tires
- <input type="checkbox" /> New rim tape
- <input type="checkbox" /> New shift cables
- <input type="checkbox" /> New chain

# üß≥ Things to bring on race day

## üìù Things you'll need the whole race

- <input type="checkbox" /> Trisuit (my favorite ones: Z3r0d Racer and Zoot's Ultra Tri P1)
- <input type="checkbox" /> Smartwatch (charged!). [Here are a few tips for setting up a garmin watch for a triathlon](https://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/doqkn5/a_few_tips_for_setting_up_a_garmin_watch_for_a/)
- <input type="checkbox" /> A transponder, worn at the ankle (provided by the organization)
- <input type="checkbox" /> [A waterproof HRM chest strap](https://www.garmin.com/fr-FR/p/770963)
- <input type="checkbox" /> Aero calf sleeves, to [be a little faster on the bike](https://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1766z7k/aero_calf_sleeves_best_ones/). Also serves as compression sleeves when running. To be worn the whole time, [under the wetsuit first](https://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/10drh2b/do_triathletes_swim_with_compression_calf_sleeves/). If no wetsuit allowed, to be worn only from the cycling leg onward.

## üèä For swimming

- <input type="checkbox" /> Swimming cap (usually provided by the organization)
- <input type="checkbox" /> Swimming goggles
- <input type="checkbox" /> Wetsuit (optional - sometimes allowed, sometimes forbidden, sometimes mandatory)

## For the transition swim -> bike

- <input type="checkbox" /> A small towel, to dry your feet and remove the dust/dirt

## üö¥ For cycling

- <input type="checkbox" /> Race bike (make it lightweight! remove unnecessary equipment)
- <input type="checkbox" /> Bike computer (optional)
- <input type="checkbox" /> Helmet
- <input type="checkbox" /> Glasses
- <input type="checkbox" /> Bike shoes
- <input type="checkbox" /> Fingerless gloves
- <input type="checkbox" /> Water bottles, already on the bike. One filled with only water, the other with isotonic powder and water.
- <input type="checkbox" /> Low cut socks, that you'll wear for both the cycling and running legs
- <input type="checkbox" /> A triathlon belt to carry gels and display the bib number, to be worn until the end of the race
- <input type="checkbox" /> Gels: have some in the belt, some on the bike. Aim for your weight in grams of carbs per hour: you weight 75 kgs, you take 75 grams per hour.
- <input type="checkbox" /> Anti puncture liquid for tubes / sealant: Interesting readings: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/3t0g71/puncture_in_race/) and [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/IronmanTriathlon/comments/p1hohl/comment/h8e6c9n/)
- <input type="checkbox" /> 2 CO2 cannisters with inflator, to store in the saddle bag
- <input type="checkbox" /> 2 or 3 spare tubes, in the saddle bag too
- <input type="checkbox" /> Glueless patches, in the saddle bag too
- <input type="checkbox" /> Tire levers and multi tool, in the saddle bag too
- <input type="checkbox" /> A mini pump, attached to the bike frame

## üèÉ For running

Wear the same cycling glasses. Keep the aero calf sleeves on. Stock up on gels again during the bike -> run transition, again aim for your weight in grams of carbs per hour.

- <input type="checkbox" /> [Race running shoes]({filename}/running-and-pronation.md)
- <input type="checkbox" /> A cap (optional)
