Summary: Some of the best TV series in the last decade

The past decade offered us a bunch of high-quality TV series. Here are my favorite ones (not sorted).

# Shows still running

## [Altered Carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_Carbon_(TV_series))

New stuff from Netflix, looks rad!

## [Narcos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcos)

It tells the story of Pablo Escobar. Produced by Netflix, 4 seasons.

##Â [Black Mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror)

An interesting analyze of our modern society.

## [The Walking Dead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_%28TV_series%29)

A post-apocalyptic TV show, featuring... zombies! The scenario, based on the comic book series of the same name, is pretty good. By the way, if you have the opportunity, read them all!

## [Fear The Walking Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_the_Walking_Dead)

Prequel to The Walking Dead! Seems really interesting so far...

## [Vikings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikings_%28TV_series%29)

An Irish-Canadian historical drama television series. Everything goes fast, which is quite appreciable, compared to Game of Thrones, where some episodes are less interesting than others.

## [Better Call Saul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Call_Saul)

A spin-off of Breaking Bad: same ambiance, a must-see!

A great TV series produced by Netflix!

# Ended or Canceled TV series

## [Mr. Robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot_%28TV_series%29)

A hilarious sitcom about a group of geeks founding a startup company. Extremely funny!
