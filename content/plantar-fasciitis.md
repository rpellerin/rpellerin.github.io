Summary: Yay, another injury after too much runnning. Let's see how I heal this time...

Alright alright alright. April the 3rd, 2022, I ran my first official half-marathon, in Berlin. Oh boy was it tough! But I did it. 2 hours and 22 seconds, official time. Not bad, although I must admit I was aiming under 2 hours. But let's blame Strava, as it was giving me the finish line 500 meters shorter. Ha ha!

Of course, a race wouldn't be a race without a propre injury, would it? Well, let's be honest, it's not that bad of an injury, but still. I got... "Plantar fasciitis" (in French: *aponÃ©vrosite plantaire* or *fasciapathie plantaire* or *fasciite plantaire*)! To be fair, it started a week prior to the race. I overtrained (I guess). Indeed, I ran 17 kilometers exactly one week before. The next day the pain came. Not too strong, but strong enough for me to call it a discomfort. A ran the race nonethless.

A [random Google search](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/plantar-fasciitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354846) tells me that it's

> "[...] one of the most common causes of heel pain. It involves inflammation of a thick band of tissue that runs across the bottom of each foot and connects the heel bone to the toes (plantar fascia)."

Easy enough, I can understand that.

As the article describes it, you feel the pain mostly in the morning near the heel, right out of bed, and after a few minutes of walking, it starts to fade away, and eventually vanishes, until the next day.

Out of all the websites that I read (not many in all fairness), the best and easiest treatment is to go easy on exercising for at least a few weeks. I am currently at the end of my first "week off", I'll keep monitoring my pain and see how long it takes to completely heal. I only cycle these days, no more running until the pain is gone. I don't want it to become a chronic pain. Stretching a few times per day is also advised. Wearing a splint at night to hold the whole thing might also be considered. As to me, I'll keep resting for the time being and see how it goes. ðŸ¤ž
