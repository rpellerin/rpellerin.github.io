Summary: Tips for cyclists willing to go to Brocken in the Harz from Berlin

I am planning a trip from Berlin to the [Harz](https://www.nationalpark-harz.de/en), specifically the peak Brocken. As finding information turned out to be quite hard, I decided to sum things up here in a short article.

# The train ride

Two options: ride a Deutsche Bahn train, any day of the week, almost any hour. Or ride the famous **Harz-Berlin-Express** (HBZ) operated by [Abellio](https://www.abellio.de/), but only on Saturdays and Sundays. Both types of trains can be booked on the DB website. You can also book the HBZ tickets directly on [Abellio's website](https://www.abellio.de/tickets-tarife/verkaufsstellen).

# With a bike

Brocken is located in the german state called "Saxony-Anhalt", where taking a bike on a train is free (information found [here](https://www.abellio.de/tickets-und-tarife) and [here](https://www.bahn.de/service/individuelle-reise/bahn_und_fahrrad/rad-nahverkehr/bahn_und_bike_sanhalt)). Therefore, when bringing a bike on a Deutsche Bahn train, just book a bike ticket only for the part Berlin-Genthin. In other words, in the DB Navigator mobile app, just get a VBB Fahrrad ticket for the overall network of VBB (3.6 euros).

If riding a Harz-Berlin Express train, you must book a 3-euro bike ticket. I could not find where to book them online, so do it at a train station.
