Summary: Some tips for Cities Skylines

It's Christmas time! Meaning I get to play with my Nintendo Switch!

I'm a big fan of Cities Skylines. In this article, I collect a few tips and tricks I learned over the last few years, after many hours spent playing this amazing game.

# Road hierarchy

Although not always necessary, it's nice to have some sort of road hierary. To make cities less boring, I do not strictly follow these guidelines, only sometimes.

# Residential + commercial zoning

1 length = 10 tiny blocks.

## Superblocks (_à la Barcelona_)

3x3 districts surrounded by 4 or 6 lanes (two or one way). So 30x30 tiny blocks.

## Savannah-inspired - Oglethorpe Grid

### In real life

Also known as an [Oglethorpe ward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squares_of_Savannah,_Georgia#:~:text=Layout%20of%20a%20typical%20ward%20in).

A ward is made of a central park + 4 commercial blocks (the closest to the park) and 4 residential blocks (bigger than commercial, 2 are north, 2 are south). We ignore the lanes in the middle of the residential blocks.

Around a ward are 2 arterial roads (north and south) and 2 collector roads (west and east).

Around the central park are one-way streets that go anticlockwise.

The street that is north of the park is a one-way street that goes west, the one that is south of the park is also one-way, to the east.

Optionnaly, the two streets on either side of the park can be made one-way (towards the park).

### In City Skylines

We place in the middle the regular "park with trees". We surround it by a 2-lane one-way street, going anticlockwise. The neighboring streets may optionnally be turned into one-way streets:

- The one above goes west
- The one underneath goes east
- The two streets on either side of the park go towards the park

The whole ward is surrounded by 6 or 4-lane roads (ideally 6-lane roads north and south, 4-lane roads west and east).

### XL version

The central park is slightly bigger than the regular park. It's a 2x2 block. You can add a small park in there, plus a couple of pedestrian paths.

The original lanes in the middle of the residential blocks have been added back, as 2-lane roads (both ways).

### Combining Superblocks and Savannah wards

Not recommended. It makes massive blocks. But at least I've tried.
