Prague is a relatively small city, for a capital. But it is gorgeous! The city center is almost exclusively made of pedestrian-only areas, with narrow streets full of live where cobble stones are king. The architecture is beautiful, and the city is overlooked by a castle. A perfect destination in Europe for a couple of days. I went there for just a little over two days, as it's only 4 hours away from Berlin by train. Here is what I recommend.

- Go for a stroll in the park around the **Prague Metronome**.
- **Žižkov Television Towe**r: not the best point of view in the city but the tower is controversial and odd, that's worth taking a close look at it. Going to the top is relatively cheap.
- Pass by the **The Powder Tower**.
- Next to the **Old Town Square**, don't miss:

    - **Church of Our Lady before Týn**
    - **St. Nicholas' Church**
    - **Prague Astronomical Clock**: every hour on the clock, the clock goes into motion. Don't expect anything fancy, but it attracts tourists.

- I've heard the **Národní muzeum** is a must-see, although I lacked time to visit it.
- The **Dancing House** is cool to see.
- A classic, the very crowded **Charles Bridge**.
- On the left bank, the **Lennon Wall** makes for a nice detour.
- If you're headed to the top of hill via the inclided railway, stop by the **Memorial to the Victims of Communism**.
- Speaking of the hill, make sure to go to the top of the **Petrin Tower**. A hundred times better than the TV tower, better viewpoint, more fun, partly outdoors.
- There is another **St. Nicholas Church** to visit on the left bank. You can explore the inside and go to the top for a few Czech Crowns.
- Last but not least, the **Prague Castle**. There are many things to do there, most notably the **St. George's Basilica**, plan for at least 3 hours.

While you're in Prague, you HAVE to eat a Trdelník (also called Trdlo). It is amazingly good!

Accomodation-wise, I recommend staying in the Hotel Leonardo Prague, it is fairly inexpensive for a 4-star hotel, and perfectly located, close to all the rouristy places.

In Prague, you'll find many Nextbike stations and bikes in the city. It's the best way to get around!

Hope this helps. :)
