Summary: Find out about your pronation and get the right shoes

So I've been a """runner""" for quite some time now and I'm just discovering what pronation is. Apparently most people are pronated, some are supinated, and very few are normal (or neutral). I fall in the first category/neutral, based on the study of the wear of my shoes.

Being pronated means that, while standing (not moving), one's foot naturally leans inward (towards the other leg). Being supinated is the opposite, one's foot leans outward.

This also means that pronated runners tend to have the outmost part of their feet land slightly first when running, then feet roll progressively towards the inside (towards the other leg) until the full body weight is on one foot.

Here are two videos to help you figure out which category you fall in:

These days I'm looking into buying a new pair of shoes. Apparently, Asics' Gel-Kayano model is a popular one among pronated runners, supposedly their top pair of shoes. I'll update this article with some feedback about them if I end up buying them...

Finally, here are videoson how to properly run:

# 2024-03-30: Update on the shoes I bought

So I bought the Asics Gel Kayano 30, and I've got to say I'm very satisfied with them (more than 200 kms so far).

# 2024-03-30: Update on shoes I'll be considering in the future, for race days

Tip for myself: always get a half size to full size up pair of shoes, as feet expand while running.

- Saucony endorphin pro 3: it's got a carbon plate. Good for race days. [Here's a good review.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDstCaUmOZ4)
- Saucony endorphin speed 3. [Apparently they're considerably not as good as the pro 3 for racing](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/15y5uuy/endorphin_speed_3_vs_endorphin_pro_3/).
- [Asics Metaspeed Sky Paris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4k5gsbw7hE)
- Asics Metaspeed Sky+: it also has a carbon plate. For race days. Here's a [breakdown on Asics Speed Line.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/ucpefv/can_someone_break_down_the_asics_speed_line/). Asics says the Sky+ are for stride runners, while the Metaspeed Edge+ are for cadence runners (runners who mostly increase speed by increasing their cadence, as opposed to their stride length). [There's also some differences with the regular Metaspeed Sky (not +)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/12xzbdo/metaspeed_sky_or_meta_speed_sky/).
- Asics Magic Speed 3: carbon plate too. People say [it lacks superfoam](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/1adrkuz/asics_magic_speed_3_appreciation_thread/), that's why it is not a very popular racing pair of shoes. Comments often say the Metaspeed Sky+ is like the magic speed 3 on steroids.
- Asics SuperBlast: [reportedly not as fast as the Metaspeed, and meant for long distances or daily runs while the Metaspeed are meant for racing](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/16psfgl/asics_superblast_vs_metaspeed_sky/)
- I should also probably consider a non-stability pair of shoes for training, like the Asics Nimbus 30, which are their top neutral shoes, while the Kayano are their top stability shoes. Having a rotation of shoes is healthier, supposedly.
- Nike Air Zoom Alphafly NEXT%: apparently the best racing shoe made by Nike. Kelvin Kiptum broke the official marathon world record in 2023 wearing the Alphafly 3.
- Nike ZoomX Vaporfly NEXT%: their second best racing shoe.
- Nike Air Zoom Tempo NEXT%: their best training shoe.
