Summary: My advice for apartment seekers in Paris

Looking for an apartment in Paris... is a hassle. A lot of demand, too little supply. Not to mention you always - well, almost - need rent guarantors.

# First of all, where to look for apartments?

My three favorite ones, that gather ads from many agencies:

- [Leboncoin.fr](https://www.leboncoin.fr/locations/offres/ile_de_france/?th=1&ret=2&furn=1)
- [Seloger.com](http://www.seloger.com/list.htm?idtt=1&naturebien=1&idtypebien=1&ci=750110,750109,750111,750118,750119,750105,750120,750117,750112,750113,750114,750106,750104&tri=a_px&surfacemin=15&si_meuble=1)
- [Pap.fr](http://www.pap.fr/annonce/locations-appartement-paris-4e-g37771g37772g37776g37777g37778g37780g37784g37785g37786g37787-a-partir-de-15-m2)

**Pro tip**: enable the alert emails so that you get an email as soon as one ad is posted, or digest emails.

Also, don't forget about agencies' websites. To mention a few:

- [Virginia](http://www.virginia-immobilier.fr/)
- [Guy Hoquet](https://www.guy-hoquet.com/)
- [Laforêt](http://www.laforet.com/)
- [FNAIM](https://www.fnaim.fr/)

# Arranging a viewing

My tip is to always try to phone them. If no one picks up, them text the person who posted the ad if they wrote their phone number. As a last resort, email them.

In short, the email should look like this:

- State who is looking for an apartment (yourself and your gf/bf?)
- Is the apartment still on the market? If so, when can you see it?
- Your job(s) (CDD, CDI, trial period?), your position(s) (software engineer for instance) and your salaries. Indicate whether you have guarantors or not.
- Leave your phone number just in case

Once you've arranged a viewing, you should prepare the documents you are going to have to hand in along with the questions you want to ask.

# The documents

In Paris, landlords usually expect people to know what documents are required. However, this might drastically vary from one to another. Here is a list of must and optional ones. If you are extremelly well paid you might not need rent guarantors:

**Must**

- Copies of your ID and your rent guarantors' IDs
- You last three payslips (and those or your guarantors)
- Last tax notice (_avis d'impôts_)
- Your work contract (or student certificate if still a student) and your guarantors' work contracts or some proof from their employer

**Optional but often required**

- Three last rent receipts (_quittances de loyer_)
- Guarantors' land tax (_taxe foncière_). [More on this here](https://www.frenchentree.com/french-property/local-property-taxes-taxe-fonciere-and-taxe-dhabitation/)
- Guarantors' residence tax (_taxe d'habitation_). [More on this here](https://www.frenchentree.com/french-property/local-property-taxes-taxe-fonciere-and-taxe-dhabitation/).
- Sworn statement from your guarantors stating they are your guarantors (_attestation sur l'honneur_)

**Rarely required**

- Last EDF bill or sworn statement that you'be being hosted by someone (meaning you live at someone's place)
- Proof of insurance for houses (assurance habitation)
- Proof of residency for your guarantors

**However, never hand in your bank details before officially signing the apartment lease.**
Some agencies or landlords ask you to hand in these documents during the viewing. But most of the time, sending them over email is fine. Ask beforehand just in case.

# Questions to ask during the viewing

Here are a few questions I used to ask:

- Does it come with a refrigerator? Oven/stove, stovetop or range? Washing machine or connections for one? Dishwasher?
- Are windows double glazed?
- Is the neighborhood quiet and safe?
- How much is the brokerage fee? (if not renting directly from the landlord)
- How much is the deposit, if any?
- What is included in the utilities? Water, electricity, gas, heat, trash removal, Internet access, ...?
- If there fiber optic Internet?
- Are there window roller shutters?
- Is the place ventilated?
- How much is the electricity consumption per month? How bad is the insulation? (ask for the [building energy performance metrics](https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-efficiency/buildings))
- When is the apartment available?
- Is the apartment eligible for APL (_Aide personnalisée au logement_)?
- Is there a cave? Bike parking?

# Keeping track of the apartments you've found and the viewings you've done

I recommend that you create an Excel file to do that. Here is an extract of mine:

- Title of the ad
- URL
- Price per month
- Number of rooms
- Arrondissement
- Address (if known)
- Floor (lift?)
- Square meters
- Furnished or empty?
- Double bed?
- Washing machine or connections?
- Energy perfomance
- Availability (date)
- Last email sent date + time (and replies and outcome)
- Last phone call date + time (and outcome)
- Date of arranged viewing + time
- Phone number of the broker/landlord
- Viewing date and time
- Additional information

That's it! Hope this helps.
