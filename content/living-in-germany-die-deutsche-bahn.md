Summary: Foreigners think germans are punctual... they mostly are, except Die Deutsche Bahn

Just needed to rant a bit about the Deutsche Bahn,the national railway company of Germany. Most foreigners (people not living in Germany or moving to Germany from elsewhere) usually believe that trains in Germany run on time, are never disrupted nor canceled, just like in Switzerland. This could not be further from the truth. I love trains. I love german trains, their long-distances ones (ICE) and their regional ones. But damn they suck at punctuality and getting people to where they need to go.

They've just reached a record low. [In 2024](https://ibir.deutschebahn.com/2024/en/combined-management-report/product-quality-and-digitalization/the-customer-is-at-the-center-of-our-actions/punctuality/), only 62.5% of their long-distance trains reached their destination "on time" (with a delay of less than six minutes). [In 2025](https://brusselssignal.eu/2025/05/fed-up-with-delays-switzerland-severs-two-train-links-with-germany/#:~:text=Since%20April%2029%2C%20the%20EC7,now%20have%20to%20change%20trains.), Switzerland started replacing [some segments of cross-border journeys](https://www.railway.supply/en/sbb-cuts-german-train-routes-due-to-delays-at-db/) with their own SBB trains, to prevent chronic delays. They also have a policy of preventing Deutsche Bahn trains from entering the country if they are running too late.

And of course I got to experience this recently. Twice. I was going from Berlin to Basel and back.

On the way in, the train simply never reached Switzerland. The Basel stops (the last two stops) were canceled. Simply removed. We were told so about two hours before reaching our destination. Easily explained looking at how late the train was...

And on the way back, only Basel SBB was canceled last minute, like an hour before boarding. Luckily I was able to get on the train at Basel Bad Bf.

It cannot get any worse, can it?
