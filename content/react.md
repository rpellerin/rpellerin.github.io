Summary: A quick introduction to React.js

First of all, I wish you a Happy New Year. May it be full of happiness and lines of code :-)

Let's now talk about the new hotness, a JavaScript library getting more and more trendy, with an unceasingly growing community: [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). It's under active development these days, powered by Facebook (and initially created by). Basically, it's meant to build user interfaces in a web context, but recently [they also exported it to mobile development](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), alloying anyone to write some kind of cross-platform code for both Android and iOS, in JavaScript, just like Appcelerator Titanium.

At the present time, I'm still getting acquinted with it, but here are a few pieces of advice about how to [get started](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html) **correctly**.

# How to

You have 2 main tools of choice, to compile it into some browser-compliant package: Webpack or Browserify. I personally decided to go with the former, as it's the most popular and offer more possibilites. Briefly, how to start a new project with webpack:

    :::bash
    npm init # Entry point: index.js
    npm install --save react react-dom babel-preset-react babel-preset-es2015
    # The previous line is required to run React with ES6
    npm install webpack --save-dev
    # --save-dev allow us to add it to the package.json
    npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev
    # To live reload changes in the browser in development
    # MUST NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION
    npm link webpack # To make the command available as if it was installed globally
    npm link webpack-dev-server
    
    # Install babel
    npm install babel-loader --save-dev
    # OR, in case of problem
    npm install babel-loader@5.x --save-dev

## Configure webpack

There are [two ways](http://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html) to pass the configuration object to webpack. However, here we're going to use the CLI way, which uses a conf file. Create ```webpack.config.js``` at the root of the project, containing this:

    :::javascript
    module.exports = {
        // configuration
    };

That's all for now. This article is likely to be updated in a near future, stay tuned!

PS: a friend of mine also gave a talk last year, at our school, about React. He was an avant-gardist ;-)
