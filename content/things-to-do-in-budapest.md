I recently spent a little over 48 hours in Budapest for the first time and I really enjoyed it! Here are my recommendations for a nice weekend in the hungarian capital. It's a mix of what I did and what I wish I had done.

# First day

- Check out the Citadella and the Statue of Liberty (Szabadság-szobor)
- Rudas baths
- Go for a run on Margaret Island
- Get a drink at Twentysix Budapest Restaurant

# Second day

- New York café
- Visit the St. Stephen's Basilica
- Stroll in Zrínyi u. (that's where you'll find the Christmas Market in winter time) and Október 6. u.
- Then head over to the Buda side by crossing the Széchenyi Chain Bridge
- Buda Castle (free)
- The Church of Our Lady of Buda Castle (paid entrance)
- Fisherman's Bastion and Church of Saint Mary Magdalene (combined ticket)
- Head back to the Pest side
- Go see the Parliament Building from the outside
- Go eat/for a drink in the Gozsdu Court (Gozsdu udvar)

# Third day

- Heroes' Square
- Check out the Lake of the City Park and the Gatehouse Tower (Kaputorony)
- Spend most of the day in the Széchenyi Thermal Baths
