# How many reps?

For instance, to build muscle, one should reach muscle failure after 6 to 12 reps.

# How many sets?

[3-6 sets seems to be recommended quite often for hypertrophy.](https://www.mensjournal.com/health-fitness/rep-range-builds-most-muscle)

# How much rest time between sets?

Hard to find reliable data, and it seems there is no consensus. But for hypertrophy, [30-60 seconds](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19691365/) is often cited.
