Summary: All about the equivalent of Apple's airtags for Android

Years after Apple launched the Airtags, Android is finally getting its long awaited counterpart, in the form of Google's "Find My Device" network.

Yet, before this new standard, many companies had released their tags with their own networks, that would only work with their own app. Needless to say, the density of their networks is limited hence hindering their finding capabilities. Now that Google has released its network, these same companies are also launching new products that work with it. So essentially this means that besides the official AirTags from Apple, most other products either work exclusively with Apple, exclusively with Google, or exclusively with their prorietary apps. Here's a short article about what tags work with Google's network.

# Chipolo ONE Point

[Currently priced at 34 euros](https://chipolo.net/en/products/chipolo-one-point), discount codes can easily be found on Reddit. They do not support UWB (Ultra WideBand) but I'm not sure it's a big deal... Is this precision-finding feature really useful for my usages? I intend to track my luggage, not my keys...

# Pebblebee Clip for Android

[Same price range, currently at 33.95 euros](https://pebblebee.com/products/clip-for-android). They seem to be super similar to the Chipolo one. Again, no support for UWB.

# Moto Tag

[They were just announced but they haven't been released yet.](https://www.motorola.com/us/moto-tag) They will be the first tags to support USW. I might give them a chance in the future, after reviews start popping up on the Web.
