Summary: Common problems and usual solutions

# Broken derailleur cable

Recently my rear derailleur cable broke in the middle of a ride. Good thing it was on a Saturday morning, and a bike shop was only a few kilometers away.

The symptoms leading up to the moment it actually broken are pretty simple: all of a sudden, I could no longer shift to the 2 rightmost speeds. The explanation must be that the cable was so worn out that it would not slide properly/completely. After the symptoms appeared, it took about 50 gear shifts for the cable to actually break. When it did so, my rear derailleur suddently shifted to the rightmost speed (the hardest). Fun!

# Rim cracks at spokes (wheel problem)

This one is pretty hard to identify at first. For me, gradually over some rides I started noticing like a rubbing noise. The noice would be there regardless of me pedaling or not (can be hard to hear when not pedaling because of the freewheel).

Turns out this is a very common problem with wheels. Can't be fixed, all you gotta do is replace the whole wheel (or rim if you like to build wheels).

My wheels are the entry-level ones from Mavic, the Aksium. It looks like the entry-level wheels from DT Swiss (P1800 spline) are better made. Or maybe I should get the mid-level DT Swiss PR 1400 DICUT 21?

## Tips for buying wheels

- "Centerlock" is a disc brake technology
- Look for clincher wheels, not tubular
- Careful with the freehub compatibility, for me it needs to be compatible with Shimano HG-L (cause I have 11 speeds)

# How to true a wheel and fix spoke tension

Don't forget to re-align bladed spokes for best aerodynamics.

As to the tension, [this website](http://cr.lavalnord.pagesperso-orange.fr/Fiches%20Techniques%20,%20voilage%20roues,%20rayons.htm) recommends:

- 90 to 110 daN (daN = decaNewtons) for a front wheel
- 90 to 110 daN for a rear wheel right side (cassette side)
- the tensions of the spokes on the right side (cassette side) is round about 70% higher than the tension on the left side, (NB: **if the spokes are the same**)

## Mavic Aksium

- [Product page](https://www.mavic.com/fr-fr/aksium-rr0988.html).
- [Technical page](https://technicalmanual.mavic.com/tech-mavic/technical_manual/data/mavic_tech.php?display=product&macronu=29666)

After asking Mavic directly over the phone (because no information available online), they recommend the following:

- Rear wheel right side (cassette side): 90kgs, +/- 10kg
- Rear wheel left side, and front wheel: 80kgs, +/- 10kg

### Spokes

- Front wheel: 283-mm long, 2mm diameter (as measured by me)
- Rear wheel right side (cassette side): 283-mm long, 2mm diameter (as measured by me)
- Rear wheel left side: 301-mm long, 1.2x3.0mm blades (as measured by me)

That's it!
