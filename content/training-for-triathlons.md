Summary: Everything one needs to set up a home trainer

2025 is the year I'll do my first half Ironman! Big year. Big ambition.

Up until now, the longest triathlon I ever participated in was [a sprint-distance one in Berlin](https://www.berlin-triathlon.de/), in the last 2 years. Needless to say, I'm still a total noob about triathlon.

So I need to learn fast and train hard!

This article acts as my shopping list but also my diary, as I learn new things about triathlon. This article will serve anyone else with similar intentions. I'll keep updating this article over the next few months.

# Tri bike vs road bike with aero bars

I've had aero bars on my road bike since last Summer. I bought them when I signed up for the Ironman. Initially, I was not planning on buying a tri bike. I simply wanted to adapt my road bike to a triathlon bike. Below are 3 of the best videos I found on the topic.

But now, as I am writing these lines, I am leaning towards buying a tri bike. Nothing is decided yet at this point, but I'm seriously considering it.

# Gear for training

For this first half Ironman, I need to increase my weekly volume of cycling. Especially in winter, when the days are short and often rainy. I've used that excuse way too many times to remain indoors. So here is my shopping list, to bring my training to the next level:

- [Wahoo Kickr Core](https://www.bike24.com/p2287842.html): 489.99 euros.
- [A tri bike](https://www.canyon.com/en-de/road-bikes/triathlon-bikes/speedmax/cf/speedmax-cf-7-di2-ar1600/4304.html?dwvar_4304_pv_rahmenfarbe=R073_P06): 3,999 euros. For races. And when not racing, for the home trainer. Still undecided about that...
- [The same cassette as the one on the tri bike](https://www.bike24.com/p2759128.html): 49.99 euros. To put on the Wahoo Kickr Core.
- [A sweat net](https://www.decathlon.de/p/fahrradschutz-rollentrainer/_/R-p-1022): 12.99 euros.
- A subscription to Swift (paid) or MyWhoosh (free)

## Inexpensive things you might already have at home

- A yoga mat to put under the home trainer, so as to avoid noise and sweat stains on the floor
- A fan
- A small towel
