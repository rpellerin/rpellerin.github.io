Summary: A list of barefoot shoes to consider

Tiny article here to say that I'm buying barefoot shoes (a.k.a minimalist shoes) for everyday use! Why? To strength my feet while walking, apparently on the long term these shoes help prevent running injuries. I'll start rotating my shoes, between my classic sneakers and these new barefoot shoes. Running-wise, I'll stick to big cushioned shoes for now.

After hours spent researching the web, here a list of shoes I considered/am considering for the future, in no particular order:

- [Feelgrounds](https://www.feelgrounds.com/collections/shoes)
- [Vivobarefoot Geo Court III](https://www.vivobarefoot.com/de/geo-court-iii-mens)
- [Xero Shoes](https://www.xeroshoes.eu/shop/product-category/best-sellers/): [a good review](https://www.reddit.com/r/BarefootRunning/comments/xtnzps/my_xero_prios_after_2_years_of_moderate_use/) on the Prios. Can run with them too. I would probably buy them next, after the Whitin ones I got.
- [Whitin shoes](https://whitin-shoes.com/): an [Amazon-only](https://www.amazon.de/Whitin-Unisex-Barefoot-Minimalist-Zero-Drop/dp/B0B4R21ZQJ) brand. [A review here](https://anyasreviews.com/whitin-barefoot-sneakers-review/). Those are the ones I got.
- Altra: not considered barefoot or minimalist because they have cushion, despite a wide toebox and zero drop.
- Vibram 5 Fingers (a.k.a VFF)
- Lems
- [Mukishoes](https://mukishoes.com/product-category/grownups/)
