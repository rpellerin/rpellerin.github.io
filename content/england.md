Summary: What to do and see in England

England is so much more than just England. This article sums up my past trips and my advice about what to do or see there.

# London

London is to England what Paris is to France, plus the shittier weather minus all the monuments. It's a brilliant mix of new and old buildings, pop culture and traditions. All in all, here is my advice on what to do in London:

- London Eye
- Big Ben
- Buckingham Palace (go see Changing the Guard)
- Tower Bridge
- The British Museum (it's free!)
- The Shard
- 30 St Mary Axe
- The Walkie-Talkie (aka 20 Fenchurch Street) and most specifically the Sky Garden: check out the opening hours cause walk-in guest access is restricted. Booking in advance is advised (it's free!).
- Camden Town (cool district!)
- Tate Modern (awesome modern art gallery)
- Harrods (luxury department store)
- Platform 9 3/4 and the Harry Potter shop, at King's Cross
- Tower of London (aka Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress of the Tower of London): the Jewel House is truly amazing!

## Advice for first-time visitors

- No need to tag off when getting off buses unless you want to get charged twice
- Sometimes, buying an Oyster card is more expensive than a 1-day travelcard (around 12 pounds if my memory serves well). It's a paper ticket that allows you to ride buses, tram and the tube within the London travel zones, anytime after 9:30am Mondays to Fridays and all day on weekends.

# Manchester

A beautiful small city, with a lot of industrial legacy. A couple of interesting stuff to do:

- Beetham Tower
- Check the pubs out, some of them have live bands playing at night, pretty much like in Ireland
- Museum of Science and Industry

# Liverpool

Land of soccer and the Beatles. Great city with plenty of activities. Quite close to Manchester. I remember going to at least two of these three places:

- Merseyside Maritime Museum
- The Beatles Story
- Tate Liverpool

You should definitely check these places out!

The one time I went to Liverpool, I had the chance to attend a soccer match, Liverpool v Everton. What a great experience! The atmosphere was unique, everybody was cheering and acclaiming and drinking!

# Bristol

Not too much to do there but yet quite a nice town, very typical. If you're just passing through, make sure to stop at the Clifton Suspension Bridge, an impresive highly suspended bridge! If you're afraid of heights, pass on that on.

That's it for now!
