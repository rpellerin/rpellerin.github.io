Summary: Some tips for these triathlon bikes

- The [official Canyon cockpit mount](https://www.canyon.com/en-de/gear/accessories/bike-tech/cockpit-and-handlebar-mounts/canyon-cockpit-mount/9102035.html) cannot be mounted on the Speedmax, as it needs to be screwed in two holes. The only hole present in the cockpit is for [the hydration system](https://www.canyon.com/en-de/gear/accessories/bike-accessories/cycling-water-bottle/canyon-speedmax-hydration-system/10014133.html). A bike computer mount is also already present on the hydration system. Therefore, without the hydration system installed, a generic bike computer mount can be installed on the aero bars instead:

      - [ZIPP QuickView TT Computer Mount for Garmin Edge](https://www.bike24.com/p274637.html)

- The small plastic part between the two screws for the bottle holder is the cable holder. It prevents the brake line from rattling inside the frame. It should be left as it is, no need to cover it.

- The wheel tightening lever can be left on one of the wheels (front one is my recommendation, if it falls you'll most likely hear it). Just push hard enough until it clicks.
- The bike comes with tubes installed, not tubeless.
- The 4 rubber plugs: 3 should go to the back of the seat post. One is spare, it can go underneath the handlebar in the middle, there's the hole for the hydration system that can be filled. Canyon said this hole does not necessarily have to be sealed though. Canyon also suggests to use the plugs for the holes of the bottle cages, if unused.

- The Shimano Adjustment Gauge (made of cardboard) for RD-D7100/R7150 RX820 is meant to set the correct distance between the rear derailleur's guide pulley and the largest cog on the cassette.
- The two wedges that say "Inner Dia. 20.5-22.5" are [spart parts of the DURA-ACE Dual Control Lever (ST-R9180)](https://si.shimano.com/de/pdfs/ev/ST-R9180-4089/EV-ST-R9180-4089A.pdf), that [go between the brakes and the handlebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1idyomy/brakeshift_lever_part_needed/). They are of no use when assembling the bike. Canyon was not able to tell me what to use them for.
- Shimanoo tools TL-EW300 and TL-EW02: they are needed to connect/disconnect Di2 cables (at the cockpit/aero bars, or at the rear derailleur).

- The T6 Torx screwdriver was not needed during assembly. It might be required to service the bike and change some parts, I don't know. Canyon's support was not more knowledgeable about it, they only mentioned "to tweak some small screws securing Di2 junction boxes or electronic shifting cable covers or other compatible screws".

- The chain comes pre-greased with standard grease, no need to degrease+grease again. I asked Canyon's support about this:

      > Your bike should be ready to ride right out of the box, as Canyon typically preps the bike with the necessary lubricants and greases. However, it’s always a good idea to check the chain and drivetrain.

      > If the chain feels overly greasy or has excess lubrication on it, you can wipe it down with a clean cloth, but there should be no need to degrease and re-grease unless you want to ensure it's in perfect condition.

      > As long as you haven’t encountered any issues with shifting or the bike seems properly set up, you're good to go! Always double-check the brakes, tire pressure, and overall setup before riding.
