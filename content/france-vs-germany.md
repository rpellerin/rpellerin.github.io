Summary: What each country does better than the other

# France is better at...

- **Pensions** are much higher (2/3 of your last payrol in France on average, compared to 1/3 in Germany)
- **Healthcare system**: although comparable, in Germany one has to pay out of their own pocket for healthcare insurance when unemployed. Also, the whole public/private insurances make doctors more business men than heathcare professional sometimes. For example it's easier to get an appointment at an earlier date, or easier to get an appointment at a doctor never visited before if you are privately insured.
- **Worked hours**: typically 40 in Germany by law. In France, it's 35 hours by law, but most people work more and [get paid for these extra hours](https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F34151).
- **Paid vacation**: minimum 20 days in Germany by law, vs 25 in France
- **Trains**: although the SNCF is far from perfect, its trains are by an order of magniture more punctual ([1](https://www.thelocal.de/20220727/opinion-the-shocking-state-of-german-trains-exposes-the-myth-about-punctuality), [2](https://www.arte.tv/de/videos/107194-015-A/re-chaos-auf-der-schiene/))

# Germany is better at...

- **Public holidays**: overall, it's comparable to France. However, some specific days are particulariy appreciated: half of December 24, December 26, and half of December 31 are holidays in Germany
- **Safety**: big cities are much safer
- **Cycling**: cyclists are respected by drivers. Also, cycling lanes are found everywhere outside of cities.
- **Saunas**: the German sauna culture is simply the best in the world! Aufguss ❤️
