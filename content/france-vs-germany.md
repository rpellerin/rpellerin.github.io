Summary: What each country does better than the other

# France is better at...

- **Pensions** are much higher (2/3 of your last payrol in France on average, compared to 1/3 in Germany)
- **Healthcare system**: although comparable, in Germant one has to pay out of their own pocketfor healthcare insurance when unemployed. Also, the whole public/private insurances make doctors more business men than heathcare professional sometimes.

- **Worked hours**: 40 in Germany by law, vs 35 in France
- **Paid vacation**: 20 days in Germany by law, vs 25 in France
