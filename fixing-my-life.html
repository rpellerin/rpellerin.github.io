<article>
    <p>I have spent the last few months trying to "fix my life". To put it differently, I tried to identify what was wrong and how I could improve my life in general. Although in good shape and healthy, I wanted to be more energetic. Likewise, I had a few bad habits that I wanted to get rid of. Let's go through them:</p>
<h1 id="health">Health</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quit smoking</strong>: that was definitely the hardest. In total, I'd say it took me several months.</li>
<li><strong>Exercice at least 30mins per day</strong>: not always doable. At KAIST, I am fortunate enough to have a gym right next to my dorm.</li>
<li><strong>Eat healthy food in moderate quantities (not too much, not too little)</strong>: not easily doable at KAIST. Ultimately, I'd like to become <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KriTQ0aTrtw">a vegetarian</a></strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Stop using electronic devices at least 1 hour before going to sleep</strong>: this is important in order to sleep well. Screens are known to prevent you from falling asleep.</li>
<li><strong>Every hour of sitting, stand up for a few minutes</strong>: <a href="http://www.everythingsouthcity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Sitting-page-001.jpg">more info</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="culture">Culture</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read books (novels) in English</strong>: I am reading "Animal Farm" at the time being.</li>
<li><strong>Keep learning English on a regular basis</strong>: the book "The Elements of Style" is on my nightstand.</li>
<li><strong>Write in English</strong>: that's what I do with this blog.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="lifestyle">Lifestyle</h1>
<ul>
<li>Owning as few things as possible. Ideally my whole life would fit in two suitcases.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_INOPfPdhB4">Anti-consumerism</a>. It is a mindset I adopted a while ago.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="other">Other</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check Twitter two times a day tops</strong>: that one is pretty hard, I am still struggling.</li>
<li><strong>Go to bed before 2am</strong>: same. At some point in the future, being a morning person?</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, I also started learning about topics that are not related to my skills whatsoever, such as politics, the environment, green energies, etc. I would recommend these videos as a good starting point:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90CkXVF-Q8M">Before the Flood</a>: <em>Join Leonardo DiCaprio as he explores the topic of climate change, and discovers what must be done today to prevent catastrophic disruption of life on our planet.</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoGH7d51bvc">Réformons l'élection présidentielle (FR)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.demain-lefilm.com/en/film">Demain</a>: <em>Climate is changing. Instead of showing all the worst that can happen, this documentary focuses on the people suggesting solutions and their actions.</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, I recently found that <a href="http://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/a-23-minute-morning-ritual-that-will-transform-your-whole-day.html">interesting article</a> which suggests "<em>A 23-Minute Morning Ritual That Will Transform Your Whole Day</em>". I am still working on it... Essentially, it gives 5 things to do in the morning:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write down three acts of gratitude (2 minutes)</li>
<li>Journal one positive experience you've had during the past 24 hours (2 minutes)</li>
<li>Exercise (15 minutes)</li>
<li>Meditation (2 minutes)</li>
<li>Express kindness through a text or email (2 minutes)</li>
</ol>
<p>Last but not least, here are my <strong>New Year's Resolutions for 2017</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read more</li>
<li>Play another musical instrument</li>
<li>Learn Dutch and Spanish</li>
<li>Learn how to dance Rock and Roll or salsa or swing.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="update-2023-10-01">UPDATE: 2023-10-01</h1>
<p>I was just randomly scrolling through past articles on my blog when I stumbled upon this one. I thought this deserved an update, 6 years later! Let's go through all the bullet points I had listed back then and try to see what happened with each.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quit smoking</strong>: I must admit this was kind of a lie. When I wrote this I was in South Korea. I had greatly reduced how much I smoked but I would not say I had completely stopped. I remember smoking a couple of times in nightclubs there. Also, the following year (2017), I started smoking again while in San Francisco. I remember my own deception after so many months without smoking. Anyways. My very last cigarette drag was in July or August 2019. Since then, not a single one. :)</li>
<li><strong>Exercice at least 30mins per day</strong>: if my 30-minute times two bike commute and my daily walks in the park nearby count towards it, then I definitely hit that! If not, then I'm very close, and my weekly exercise time is way above 4 hours anyways, thanks to regular long bike rides on the weekend.</li>
<li><strong>Eat healthy food in moderate quantities (not too much, not too little)</strong>: hell yeah, this has become second nature since <a href="https://romainpellerin.eu/cycling-and-being-vegetarian.html">a couple</a> <a href="https://romainpellerin.eu/objectif-75-kg-et-toucher-le-sol.html">of months now</a>. Hopefully it'll stick long time. Back in 2016 I mentioned that I wanted to become vegetarian ultimately... This happened end of 2018 and I am still vegetarian to this day. No reason to change that.</li>
<li><strong>Stop using electronic devices at least 1 hour before going to sleep</strong>: that one never worked. On my phone till the very last minute.</li>
<li><strong>Every hour of sitting, stand up for a few minutes</strong>: whenever I'm in the office, yeah I totally do that. At home it depends on how focused on some task I am, but I mostly do it.</li>
<li><strong>Read books (novels) in English</strong>: huge hiatus from the end of 2019 until 2 months ago, when I started reading Hyperion.</li>
<li><strong>Keep learning English on a regular basis</strong>: not at all. I guess my current level is more than enough. On the flipside, I'm considering learning German further and aim for the B2 level (my current level is A2/B1).</li>
<li><strong>Write in English</strong>: every single day, at work, texting friends, on this blog, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Owning as few things as possible. Ideally my whole life would fit in two suitcases</strong>: the 2 suitcases thingy... yeahhhh no. Can't happen. Won't happen. But I'm still trying to only own stuff than I truly need. Like I never buy clothes or shoes, I think I already have enough for the next 10 years. Not that I have so many, but who needs more than 3 pairs of jeans, or 20 t-shirts?</li>
<li><strong>Anti-consumerism</strong>: yup, still valid, that's me. Only buy what you need. I favor second hand as much as possible, except for things I know I will keep for life or whose lifespan isn't so long.</li>
<li><strong>Check Twitter two times a day tops</strong>: <a href="https://romainpellerin.eu/twitter-we-are-breaking-up.html">I broke up with Twitter 🎉</a>. Now I'm struggling with Youtube. I spend way too much time watching random shit.</li>
<li><strong>Go to bed before 2am</strong>: am I ever gonna learn?! Overall there has been improvement. I'm usually in bed before 1am, now targeting midnight.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's check out my <strong>New Year's Resolutions for 2017</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read more: failed, at best I maintained the same level.</li>
<li>Play another musical instrument: major failure. I did buy a ukulele in 2018 though 😂</li>
<li>Learn Dutch and Spanish: not even tried. Did I mention German? 😅</li>
<li>Learn how to dance Rock and Roll or salsa or swing: some day, some day...</li>
</ul>
<p>Ha ha that was funny, looking back at the old me from 2016 and my life goals. What would I add today? Probably more stretching, more weight lifting, at least more frequently. Going to bed earlier, rising earlier? And more German of course! Meet me here in a few years for an update. 😉</p>
