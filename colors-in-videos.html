<blockquote>
<p>First of all, 10 bit HDR is not one thing, they are two things. That's why sometimes you see 10 bit SDR as well. One refers to the color range (8-bit vs 10 bit), and the other refers to the dynamic range (SDR vs HDR).</p>
<p>8 bits or 10 bits? Most of our lives, we've been watching the world in 8-bit color. When you break down what 8-bit color is, it refers to the number of gradations in each of the primary colors. When you hear 8-bit, that means there are 256 discrete possible gradations. That is 256 levels of red, 256 levels of green, and 256 levels of blue, since red, green and blue are the basic colors of each pixel on your TV set. When your TV combines these three colors in all their 256 possible gradations you end up with 256 x 256 x 256 = 16,777,216 (16.7 million) colors! That should be sufficient for most video, right? Well, not when you're doing professional photography or filming.</p>
<p>There are times when you might have seen an effect called banding on your TV set. These are areas where the gradients are not as smooth in transitioning between subtle color differences. Instead, they look like bands of similar looking colors. This may be apparent in some blue sky scenes when looking at the horizon, or when there is a slow fade to black transition between scenes. Of course, this depends on how your TV processes the colors, then type of input you use, the player you're using to decode the video, or how the content you're watching is encoded.</p>
<p>So, here's where 10-bit color comes to the rescue. With 10 bit color, you get 1024 gradations for each of the primary colors, resulting in a whooping 1,073,741,824 colors. That's over 1 billion colors! That oughta get rid of those bands and give you smoother gradients.</p>

<p>Some monitor or TV are "10-bit like" but not truly 10-bit, there are in fact <a href="https://www.benq.com/en-us/knowledge-center/knowledge/10-bit-vs-8-bit-frc-monitor-color-difference.html">"8 bit + FRC"</a>.</p>
<h1 id="sdr-vs-hdr">SDR vs HDR</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/4kTV/comments/tm3doe/hdr_vs_sdr_vs_10_bit_vs_8_bit/">Source</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HDR or SDR? Most of our lives, we've been watching the world in SDR, or Standard Dynamic Range. Now, with newer TVs, we get this feature called HDR, or High Dynamic Range. This refers to how bright or how dark your pixels on your TV are capable of representing luminosity in the video. Instead of just adding artificial contrast to the image, HDR actually controls the individual luminosity for each pixel. This effect looks even nicer on OLED TVs which causes the image to look more realistic. Light bulbs in the background of a dark scene appear as if they are really there and the difference between dark and bright spots is less likely to be washed out.</p>
<p>One of the limitations of older TV sets all this time, was the brightness bleeding effect of bright objects next to dark ones on the same scene. If your TV supports HDR, you can have a bright white object shining at maximum brightness, and it will not affect how a dark object in the next pixel looks like. HDR, therefore, preserves details in scenes where the contrast ratio of the monitor could otherwise be a hindrance.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with photography, dynamic range is measured in stops, comparable to the aperture of a camera. Pictures on a typical SDR display would have a dynamic range of about 6 stops. HDR information, but on the other side, has the potential to almost triple this dynamic range, with a total of 17.6 stops.</p>

<hr>
<p>It is commonly admitted that "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/143p9mz/comment/jndhhje/">HDR is a combination of three things</a>" (although <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/4kTV/comments/tm3doe/comment/i1zjkln/">technically HDR has nothing to do with 8 or 10 bits</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>More than 8 (usually 10) bits per subpixel</li>
<li>Displays with a higher than usual peak brightness and contrast ratio (usually oled, or an lcd with full array local dimming)</li>
<li>All the required metadata to make proper use of the above</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gopro/comments/xe0wfx/comment/ioe0u1z/">Source</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HDR refers to the dynamic range. How much the camera can capture from complete white to complete dark. It's also intertwined with the gamuts of the camera. You need a wider gamut and 10+ bit color depth to get a somewhat pleasing HDR effect to look good.</p>

<h1 id="hdr10-vs-dolby-vision-vs-hdr10-vs-hlg">HDR10 vs Dolby Vision vs HDR10+ (vs HLG)</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/4kTV/comments/tm3doe/hdr_vs_sdr_vs_10_bit_vs_8_bit/">Source</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are two popular HDR standards, Dolby Vision and HDR10. Since HDR10 is open source, it has been much more widely adopted than Dolby Vision. Both HDR formats use metadata in the video stream to determine how bright pixels should light up in the display. With HDR10, a fixed metadata range is declared at the start of the stream, and it remains for the entire length of the video, whereas Dolby Vision is capable of dynamic metadata from one scene to the next. There is an upgrade to HDR10 called HDR10+ which adds dynamic metadata just like Dolby Vision. Overall, you can think of HDR as the ability of the video stream to adjust your contrast and brightness levels on your TV set for each pixel separately, as opposed to your brightness and contrast menus which affect the entire picture at once.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDR10">Competing formats to HDR10 are Dolby Vision and HDR10+ (which do provide dynamic metadata, allowing to preserve the creative intents on each display and on a scene by scene or frame by frame basis), and also HLG (which provides some degree of backward compatibility with SDR).</a></p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDR10%2B">HDR10+ and Dolby Vision do not use the same dynamic metadata.</a></p>
<h1 id="transfer-functions-gamma-24-vs-hdr-pg-vs-hdr-hlg">Transfer functions: Gamma 2.4 vs HDR PG vs HDR HLG</h1>
<p>PQ is for "Perceptual Quantize", the standard is known as ST.2084. HLG is for "Hybrid Log-Gamma".</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rec._2100#Transfer_functions">Both were introduced with Rec2100</a> (see next section). Prior to Rec2100, Rec709 and Rec2020 were using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU-R_BT.1886">Gamma 2.4 (known as ITU-R BT.1886)</a>.</p>
<p>As written in the section above, HLG is opposed to HDR10, Dolby Vision and HDR10+.</p>
<p><a href="https://lightillusion.com/what_is_hdr.html">This page</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PQ HDR defines HDR10, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision, as all use the same target colour space - Rec2020 Gamut, with the same PQ EOTF. Consequently, calibration for all is basically identical. HLG based HDR is different.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the page is extremely detailed and full of information.</p>
<p>Some things to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>PQ gives absolute values for light output</li>
<li>HLG gives relative values</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the often overlooked potential issues with PQ based HDR for home viewing is that because the standard is absolute there is no way to increase the display's light output to overcome surrounding room light levels - the peak brightness cannot be increased, and neither can the fixed gamma (EOTF) curve.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, with PQ based HDR the Average Picture Level (APL) will approximately match that of regular SDR (standard dynamic range) imagery. The result is that in less than ideal viewing environments, where the surrounding room brightness level is relatively high, the bulk of the PQ HDR image will appear very dark, with shadow detail potentially becoming very difficult to see. This is still true with a diffuse white target of 200 nits, rather than the original 100 nits diffuse white.</p>
<p>But, having said that, HLG based HDR has its own issues if the peak luma of the display is below approx. 1000 nits, as the average picture level of the HDR image will appear dimmer than the equivalent SDR image.</p>
<p>HDR10 uses Static metadata, while Dolby Vision and HDR10+ use Dynamic.</p>
<p>And non-PQ based HDR, such as HLG, has no need for metadata. One of the major differences in using a relative based HDR standard, rather than absolute.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've read on other websites that Dolby Vision also works with HLG, not just PQ.</p>
<h1 id="rec709-vs-rec2020-vs-rec2100">Rec709 vs Rec2020 vs Rec2100</h1>
<p>Those are color gamuts (a set of usable colors).</p>
<p>Rec709 is generally for SDR.</p>
<p>Rec2020 and Rec2100 are commonly used for HDR. Rec2020 can also be used for SDR. They are both refered to as Wide Color Gamuts (WCG).</p>
<p>Rec2020 (or Rec.2020) is an abbreviation for "<em>ITU-R Recommendation BT.2020</em>".</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rec._2100#System_colorimetry">Rec. 2100 uses the same color primaries as Rec. 2020 which is a Wide Color Gamut</a> (meaning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut#Wide_color_gamut">a color gamut wider than that of BT.709</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/IXYKhZdGF6s?t=109">Rec709 is recommendations for HD. Rec2020 for UHD (Ultra HD). Rec2100 for HDR.</a></p>
