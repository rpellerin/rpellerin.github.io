    <h1 id="training">Training</h1>
<p>On April 13, 2025, I was taking part in <a href="https://romainpellerin.eu/marathon-de-paris-2025-race-report.html">the Paris marathon</a>. My first IRONMAN 70.3 was meant to be exactly 7 weeks later. That left very little time for specific training. The Paris marathon was my main objective of this first half of 2025. So in December last year, I laid out a plan as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full focus on marathon training. A 13-week training plan starting in January, with 5 runs a week.</li>
<li>In addition, one mandatory swim per week of at least 1,000 meters. I don't have a coach, I'm not in a triathlon club, and I did not want to do specific drills, just plain swimming, trying to improve my endurance.</li>
<li>Every Monday: gym. Weight lifting. Pecs, arms, legs. To look good of course but also help with swimming and running.</li>
<li>One optional bike ride on the weekend, if the weather was good enough. I also bought a home trainer in the middle of winter to complement my training.</li>
</ul>
<p>I paused swimming in the last two weeks before the marathon.</p>
<p>Then, after the marathon, I took a full week off from all kinds of sport, and then started training specifically for this IRONMAN 70.3.</p>
<p>Having a sore left foot after the marathon (it's still sore today as I'm writing this article!), I lightened up the running training, from 5 to 2 or 3 runs a week. The pain is not too bad, 1/10 when walking, 4/10 at the beginning of any runs then it drops to 1/10. But still annoying. And I did not want to make it worse.</p>
<p>I resumed swimming once a week, and even increased to 2 or 3 times in the last 3 weeks ahead of the race.</p>
<p>Cycling-wise, we went to Bavaria one full week in the beginning of May to specifically train and focus on cycling. The rest of the time, I kept on commuting with my bike of course and the occasionnal weekend ride. All in all, in may, including commute rides, I cycled more than 1,000 kms.</p>
<h1 id="gear">Gear</h1>
<p>The most stressful part of triathlons is logistics and gear, if you ask me. <a href="https://romainpellerin.eu/triathlon-checklist.html">One needs so many different things</a>, especially for the cycling leg. I did not want to wait till last minute; early in the year I started buying everything I would need, week over week.</p>
<p>In March, after weeks of weighing up the pros and cons, I finally setled on buying a tri-bike. Then it took me multiple tries to adjust it and fit it correctly to me, until <a href="https://romainpellerin.eu/training-for-triathlons.html">I could finally start training with it</a>.</p>
<p>Even finding the right <a href="https://www.etsy.com/de/listing/1479204041/adapter-fur-flaschenhalter-sattelstutze">rear-mounted bottle holder</a> was a challenge.</p>
<p>Two weeks ahead of the race, I crushed by accident a Di2 cable inside one of my aero bars, because I swapped two screws of different length. Fortunately, my local bike shop was able to replace it in no time. Stressful!</p>
<p>Finally, I also traded my Decathlon trisuit for a new one from Z3R0D. I love it!</p>
<h1 id="travels">Travels</h1>
<p>Logistics. My nightmare. How to travel from Berlin to Tours, two cities more than 1,000 kms appart. We setled on a combination of train + rental car.</p>
<p>We made it a point not to disassemble our bikes on the train when traveling, cause 1. Deutsche Bahn staff can deny boarding if the luggage is deemed too big, and 2. it's hard to cram disassembled bikes in luggage racks without damaging them. Hence our choice for train whenever possible and then rental car whenever keeping bikes in one piece was no longer possible.</p>
<p>Germany's fast trains (ICE) and France's ones (TGV) usually have a few spots for bikes. By the time we booked everything, there were still spots on one from Berlin to Mannheim. But unfortunaly, all of the TGVs had no more bike spots. And time wise, it was not going to work.</p>

<p>So on Wednesday the 28th of May we set out. ICE from Berlin to Mannheim. After Mannheim, two regional trains took us to Saarbr√ºcken, from where we rented a car.</p>

<p>And at the end of this very long day, we spent a night in Paris. The next day we drove three hours to Tours.</p>

</figure>

<p>Also, side note: we rented a Polestar 2 and we absolutely loved it. Pretty good range, even when driving at 130 km/h. And fast charging stations on the freeway are truly fast, despite being quite pricey (59 cents per kWh in France, even more expensive in Germany). We never drained the battery below 20% and would not charge it past 80%. Going from 20% to 80 would usually take 30 or 35 minutes, using the most powerful charging stations (300 kW), even if the car was not able to draw more than ~100 kW.</p>
<h1 id="race-weekend">Race weekend</h1>
<p>Finally, the race weekend came. The culmination of many months of training, since signing up in August last year.</p>
<p>We arrived at <a href="https://www.olela.fr/campings/camping-mignardiere">the campsite</a> in the late afternoon, about 9 kms away from the place where the race would start. Our friends arrived at the same time. We checked in and did basically nothing that evening.</p>
<h2 id="friday">Friday</h2>
<p>The next day, we went to the Expo in the morning to collect our bib numbers and the transition bags. The place was HUGE. It was located at the Exhibition center. We checked the merch out, got our bib numbers, took a bunch of photos, and went back home. The afternoon, full body shave! Afterwards, we did a "small" recce of the bike route, 70kms out of the 87kms. The weather on that weekend was abnormaly hot and dry. 32 degrees Celsius. Damn hot. That recce ride did not go unnoticed.</p>

<h2 id="saturday">Saturday</h2>
<p>On Saturday, things got real.</p>
<h3 id="briefing">Briefing</h3>
<p>10:15am. We showed up again at the Expo for the briefing. A 30 minute long session where we all sat in tiered seats in the stands, were shown a slidedeck presented by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jaystylemusic">Jay Style</a>. After that, we went home again, only to come back a few hours later.</p>
<p>After an early lunch, we all started packing our transition bags very carefully so as not to forget anything. We also prepared our water bottles for the bike leg. Couple of checks on the bikes. Then we loaded them into the car and off we went, again to the Expo.</p>
<h3 id="bike-drop-off">Bike drop off</h3>
<p>I was a bit anxious to leave the bike in this massive building. Not because I was worried it might get stolen (almost all the other bikes were more expensive than mine üòÇ), but because 1. I was afraid I might had forgotten something and 2. I was worried about the tires, finding the bike with a puncture the next day... The usual piece of advice is to slightly deflate the tires for the night, and inflate them again just before the race. I left mine untouched.</p>

<h3 id="transition-bags-drop-off">Transition bags drop off</h3>
<p>I was even more stressed about forgetting something for my transition bags. I must have checked my check list 10 times before leaving the campsite üòÖ. But the good news was that we were going to be allowed to access our transition bags again the next day before the race.</p>
<figure class="center">

</figure>

<p>After leaving my bags, I actually forgot to leave in the blue one (the one for the bike leg) my triathlon belt and my bib number. We had been asked to wear it to be granted entry into the transition area. I simply forgot to take it off. So I went again a few minutes later to drop it off for real this time. LOL</p>
<h3 id="bed-time">Bed time</h3>
<p>19:00: dinner time. Then, a few final last checks. Swim goggles? Check. Swim caps? Check. Wetsuit? Check. Again, I must have checked my check list 10 times, only to convince myself that I was 100% ready.</p>

</figure>

<p>Unfortunately that night, there was a big football game: the UEFA Champions League final. The campsite was a bit loud between 21:00 and 23:00.</p>
<p>We got into bed around 21:45. Alarm clock set for 5:05. It was strange to try to fall asleep while it was still bright outside. With the help of a sleeping mask and earplugs, I think I fell asleep around 23:00.</p>
<p>I woke up about an hour and a half later, feeling very fine and awake, ready to go. I thought it was time to get up already. I checked the time and realized how early it was. I managed to fall asleep soon after, until 4:30 or something.</p>
<h2 id="sunday-race-day">Sunday: RACE DAY</h2>
<p>Between 4:30 and 5:00, I was half asleep and half awake. Ultimately, I got up just before my alarm clock went off, feeling a bit tired but not too much, surprisingly. I was READY!</p>
<h3 id="pre-race">Pre race</h3>
<p>I had my usual pre-race breakfast: muesli with soy milk, <a href="https://en.overstims.com/energy-cakes/gatosport">Gatosport</a> and a banana.</p>
<p>One last toilet stop. We left around 5:45. Traffic jam and road closures were to be expected. We played the smart ones. We used an alternative road, a toll road, slightly longer but we got there without any traffic jam. We only had to wait a bit to enter the parking lot, as a queue of cars had formed. We were out of the car at 6:15.</p>
<p>We rushed towards the bike park. I found a bike pump, topped up my tires with some air, left my food and water bottles on my bike and then headed towards the transition bags. There, I left my bike computer in my blue bag and my gels in my red bag. The transition area was meant to close at 6:50. We were not in a hurry. We decided to take it easy and avoid any stress, since we had pretty much nothing left to do. We left the transition area at 6:48 I think, but there were still a lot of people in the area. I doubt they shut it down on time.</p>
<h3 id="swim">Swim</h3>
<p>The queue to get into the water was massive. First, we dropped off our white bags (street wear), put our wetsuit on and got in the queue. There were "blocks"/corrals of estimated swim times. The faster swimmers started before the slower ones. I got in the 40-45 min corral. I did not get to the starting line before 7:50.</p>
<p>I had a nice surprise minutes before getting into the water. The speaker started calling out our names. Not only had my mom and one of my sisters shown up on time, they also placed themselves meters away from the starting line, and they had managed to draw the speaker's attention. We posed for a photo and that was it: we were NEXT IN LINE for the start.</p>
<figure class="center">
<img src="https://romainpellerin.eu/images/ironman-70-3-tours-2025/swim.jpg" alt="Photo of me getting into the water" />
<figcaption>The very first seconds of my race</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The swim went surprisingly well. I found a good rhythm and entered "my flow". I managed to swim freestyle the WHOLE time. Not a single second of breaststroke. The water was pretty warm (warmer than 20 degrees) and tasteless (yup, I drank much more water from the river than I would have liked üòÜ).</p>
<p>After the first half, I started thinking about calf cramps. I had had a few in the past during training. I managed to hold them off. At some point I felt one coming in the right calf, I paused 3 seconds in the water and stretched my calf with my hands. All good. False alarm.</p>
<p>Finally, last buoy. Final push... I could see the shore... I tried to reach for the ground, nope, not yet, one last stroke... and CRAMP!!!! üö® Cramp on the left calf on the very last stroke, just before coming out of the water. FUCK! The whole time I was expecting a cramp on the right calf, since I had had a few cramps there in the last few weeks. But it was alright, I could reach the ground at that point. I walked out of the water. The cramp went away after 2 or 3 steps.</p>

<figcaption>Coming out of the water. I am on the right handside, in case you had any doubt.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>My family was there again. That put a big smile on my face and gave me courage for the rest of the race.</p>
<p>It took me 43 minutes and 36 seconds to complete the 1.9 km swim.</p>
<h3 id="t1">T1</h3>
<p>Alright, time to run to the bike now. I started to pull my wetsuit down. As I was running, I realized I needed to pee. Yeah, I drank too much river water. I saw two options: go to a porta-potty or... wet myself. I was already wet from the river. And a friend had told me she had done that already in a race... I went for option 2.</p>
<p>Taking the wetsuit off took me forever. Afterwards, I realized my aero calf sleeves had slipped down to my ankles while taking off my wetsuit. I had to pull them back up over my calves. I lost a solid 30 seconds there for sure. I will not wear these ever again. Pretty useless. Shaving is nearly as good.</p>
<p>T1 was 9 minutes and 17 seconds long. There is definitely room for improvement!</p>
<h3 id="bike">Bike</h3>
<p>I already knew 70 kms of the bike leg out of 87 kms.</p>
<p>The route was beautiful! Closed to cars almost everywhere except in the last 5 kms or so. I truly loved it.</p>
<p>The "no drafting" rule was not so much followed nor enforced on the bike leg. I only saw 2 or 3 race referees on motorbikes. Since I am a fairly bad swimmer, I came out of the water with "average" cyclists. As a result, I spent the whole bike leg overtaking people. I don't remember being overtaken once.</p>
<figure class="center">

<figcaption>Posing, as always</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>My initial plan was to consume 90 grams of carbs per hour. For 2 hours and 30 minutes (my estimated bike time). I was not planning on grabing any bottle or food from aid stations. But when filling my bottles the day before, for some reason I decided to put a lot more than that in my bottles. Cause you know, why not... In the end, this is what I was carrying on my bike:</p>
<ul>
<li>2x 950-ml bottles of water with energy powder in each. One with a Maurten Drink Mix 320 and some other powdered mix from Decathlon. The other bottle with the Decathlon mix only. But each bottle had much more than one portion of powder... much more.</li>
<li>1x small bottle with water only</li>
<li>2x Maurten 100 gels + 1 energy bar</li>
</ul>
<p>Needless to say, this was WAY beyond the 90*2.5 grams of carbs I needed.</p>
<p>At some point during the first half of the ride, I lost my rear mounted bottle of plain water. I knew that it was not speed bump proof. Up until that one speed bump, we had gone over multiple ones. Every time the bottle had slipped a little but I had always been able to put it back in place in the holder. Except that one time.</p>
<p>I heard a big crashing sound behind me.</p>
<p>I guess I rode over that speed bump too fast and too harshly. I quickly glanced back, saw it and for a split second I thought "fuck it let's keep riding". But then I realized someone might have seen me see it, and I could risk disqualification. So I decided to stop and go back to pick it up. Fortunately a volunteer saw it, ran towards the bottle, picked it up for me and brought it to me as I was walking back in a clumsy manner with my bike between my legs. The bottle had burst open, only a sip of water left inside. With hindsight, I should never have stopped for it and I should have carried on. All in all I lost at least 30 seconds picking it up.</p>
<p>Another learning from that event: always carry plain water behind the saddle, not energy drink, in case you lose it, so as not to put your nutrition strategy at risk.</p>
<p>Anyways. I was back in the game. Full focus. Later on, I grabbed a bottle of water at an aid station.</p>
<p>I think I spent something like 70% of the ride on the aero bars, the rest on the handlebar, for comfort.</p>
<p>I started feeling hungry at some point on the bike, I guess my breakfast was too light but also too early. We ate at 5:15, and started swimming at 7:50. So I thought that I might as well eat a lot on the bike, since it's a lot easier than eating while running. But what I thought would be a good idea turned out to be a pretty shit idea later... Throughout the whole bike leg, I drank close to 3 liters and ate way too much. I clearly exceeded the 90 grams of carbs per hour that I was initially aiming for. I knew I was carrying too much carbs in my water bottles, but I still decided to drink it all before the run leg.</p>
<p>I saw my family once again in one of the last turns before the bike park. I then remembered too late that I had to take my feet out of the shoes so as to unmount the bike smoothly while leaving the shoes on the pedals. I kind of tried to do it last minute in a hurry but I was only able to remove my feet and put them on the shoes, I got too close to the stop line to dismount my bike gracefully while riding. I had to come to a full stop and then unmount it. Fair enough.</p>
<p>It took me 2 hours 22 minutes and 41 seconds to complete the 87 km bike ride.</p>
<h3 id="t2">T2</h3>
<p>That second transition was mostly good. After dropping off my bike, I took a piss in a porta-potty quickly and proceeded to the transition area. In the rush I forgot to take off my fingerless gloves. I realized that later while running and had to put them away in my trisuit pockets.</p>
<p>T2 was 4 minutes and 45 secondes long. I could probably have shaved off 30 seconds if I didn't have to go pee.</p>
<h3 id="run">Run</h3>
<p>The run started off really bad. In the very first few hundrer meters, I realized that my belly was WAY TOO FULL. Like bloated. That's when I realized how bad I had fucked up my nutrition on the bike. I thought it would get better over time but it did not. Every kilometer I was getting slower and slower. I knew I would not be able to eat anything during the run.</p>
<p>5 or 6 kilometers later, I had reached a point of no return. I could not hold it any longer. It was painful and I was slowing down too much. A pitstop was needed. I spotted a porta-potty at km 6.5 at an aid station and stopped for a number 2. For THREE. MINUTES. Why so long you may wonder? Cause I was drenched in sweat. It was crazy hot (24 degrees Celsius). Taking off the top of a trisuit when being sweaty takes forever. Like a minute! Same goes when putting it back on. I should have done that while running, not in the porta-potty.</p>
<p>After that, the rest of the run was great. I felt anew. Like reborn. Fast again!</p>
<p>The route was super nice. Two loops that went through an island that is actually a park, and on river banks. Away from the streets. The two loops would start and finish in the exhibition center, giving spectators a chance to see us multiple times: at the start of the run, halfway through and crossing the finish line. Which is exactly what my family did.</p>
<p>In the second half of the run, I noticed how tight my elastic laces were, especially on the left foot. I started feeling some pain growing. It remained manageable until the end but I sure will losen them next time.</p>
<p>I should have looked at the total time on my watch during the run. If I had seen that I was less than a minute away from sub 5 hours, I would have definitely been able to run faster. But overall, I am very happy with my run! I grabbed water at almost every aid station because of the heat, but I did not eat anything despite carrying 4 gels in my back.</p>
<p>Crossing the finish line was a blast! The IRONMAN 70.3 Tours is the only one in the world with an indoor finish. That was spectacular. The crowd was gathered in the stands. Music was blasting, lights everywhere. A true show!</p>

<p>It took me 1 hour 40 minutes and 41 seconds to complete the half-marathon, with a pace of 4'42"/km (pitstop included!).</p>
<p>The whole race: 5 hours and 58 seconds.</p>

<p>I am absolutely delighted! I loved every second of the race. And being with friends and family made it even more special. I can't wait to do it again!</p>
<p>Next time I need to put on anti-chafing cream between my legs. The aero position and the thin chamois led to a lot of chaving in my pelvic area.</p>
<p>Next time, I shall also eat more for breakfast, and/or bring food to eat 1 hour before the beginning of the race, like a slice of Gatosport. I can't eat so early before a race, I guess my body is fast at digesting.</p>
<p>Anyways, this concludes a lengthy article about my very first IRONMAN 70.3! üèÖ</p>
