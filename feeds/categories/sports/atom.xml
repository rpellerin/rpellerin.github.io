Apparently most people are pronated, some are supinated, and very few are normal (or neutral). I fall in the first category, based on the study of the wear of my shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being pronated means that, while standing (not moving), one's foot naturally leans inward (towards the other leg). Being supinated is the opposite, one's foot leans outward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also means that pronated runners tend to have the outmost part of their feet land slightly first when running, then feet roll progressively towards the inside (towards the other leg) until the full body weight is on one foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are two videos to help you figure out which category you fall in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days I'm looking into buying a new pair of shoes. Apparently, Asics' Gel-Kayano model is a popular one among pronated runners, supposedly their top pair of shoes. I'll update this article with some feedback about them if I end up buying them...&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Sports"></category><category term="running"></category><category term="pronation"></category></entry><entry><title>Cycling and Being Vegetarian</title><link href="//romainpellerin.eu/cycling-and-being-vegetarian.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-06T20:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2023-10-01T01:38:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Romain Pellerin</name></author><id>tag:romainpellerin.eu,2023-08-06:/cycling-and-being-vegetarian.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Because nutrition is complex, here's an article about basics and a couple of recipes&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let's face it: nutrition is not an easy topic. And it gets even harder when you're vegetarian and you like to exercise a little more than the average person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've read many articles, some good, some bad, but at the end of the day what I really want and need is a list of recipes for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My everyday life, to remain fit, healthy, and maximize muscle recovery after my weekend rides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Races: I'm never so sure what to eat on the days leading up to the race, during the race, and after.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here goes. This article will cover some basics and give a couple of recipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="basics"&gt;Basics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any cyclist (or athlete really) needs proteins and nutrients to perform well on the bike but also promote recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="first-vocabulary"&gt;First, vocabulary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grains are the seeds of grasses. Examples include: wheat, corn, oats, and rice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pulses are the seeds of legumes. Examples include: beans, peas, lentils, soybeans, peanuts, and chickpeas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nuts are the seeds of trees. Examples include: walnuts, hazelnuts, and pecans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="proteins"&gt;Proteins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a vegetarian, proteins can be found in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dairy foods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eggs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nuts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lentils&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soya products (tofu, tempeh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wholegrains (such as bread, oats, pasta, rice and millet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quinoa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only chia seeds, soya and quinoa have all 8 essential amino acids. (&lt;a href="https://www.chemicalforums.com/index.php?topic=83121.0"&gt;are there 8 or 9 essential amino acids?&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is to combine different sources of proteins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grains with &lt;a href="https://pulses.org/what-are-pulses/visual-guide-to-pulses"&gt;pulses&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;céréales et légumineuses&lt;/em&gt;): rice/whole wheat pasta and black beans/kidney beans, rice and lentils&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grains with dairy: muesli and milk, porridge (rolled oats (&lt;em&gt;flocons d'avoine&lt;/em&gt;) and milk) - apparently (raw overnight oats are healthier than cooked oats)[https://simplyoatmeal.com/benefits-of-overnight-oats-vs-cooked-oats/]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;soya with vegetables: tofu and vegetable stir-fry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grains or pulses with nuts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dairy or eggs with vegetables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iron"&gt;Iron&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type of iron found in plants is less easy for your body to absorb than is the iron found in meat. However, you can increase the amount absorbed by eating a vitamin C-rich food (i.e. fruit, vegetables) at the same time as iron-rich foods. -- (&lt;a href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/nutrition/cyclists-guide-following-vegetarian-diet-302982"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good plant sources of iron include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wholegrains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quinoa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nuts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lentils&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leafy green vegetables: spinach, broccoli, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dried fruit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Egg yolk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good sources of vitamin C are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cooked broccoli&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brussels sprouts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kale (&lt;em&gt;chou frisé&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raw spinach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kiwis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oranges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strawberries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lemons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://und.edu/student-life/dining/_files/docs/fact-sheets/iron.pdf"&gt;Vinegar also helps with iron absorption.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="omega-3"&gt;Omega-3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oomega-3 fats are found in three different forms: DHA, EPA and ALA. ALA is most abundant in plant-based sources, but DHA and EPA are difficult to obtain on a vegetarian diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, omega-3 rich food is also usually rich in omega-6. It is recommended to preserve a balance omega-6/omega-3 pretty low, around 4:1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources of omega-3 fats are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flax seeds (&lt;em&gt;graines de lin&lt;/em&gt;) (great omega-6/omega-3 ratio: 1:4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chia seeds (omega-6/omega-3 ratio: 1:3) - &lt;a href="https://www.medichecks.com/blogs/news/omega-6-3-experiment-part-2-the-results"&gt;ground seeds are better than whole seeds when it comes to omega-3 availability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walnuts (4:1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kidney Beans (1:2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pumpkin seeds (100:1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These provide alpha linoleic acid (ALA), which is converted to EPA and DHA in the body, but only at a limited rate. A good way to get more EPA and DHA is through Algal oil. &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323144#fish-and-seafood-sources"&gt;Seaweed, nori, spirulina, and chlorella are different forms of algae containing DHA and EPA.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="b12"&gt;B12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a vegetarian, B12 is normally never an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="some-ideas-of-recipes"&gt;Some ideas of recipes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id="everyday-life"&gt;Everyday life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="very-often"&gt;Very often&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon a day of chia seeds or flax seeds for omega-3, in a salad, in a dairy product, or in anything really&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any combination of grains with pulses such as pasta (whole wheat) or rice with lentils or beans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quinoa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leafy greens: Kale, Spinach, Broccoli, Iceberg lettuce, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nuts: cashews, or walnuts being the best of all. In a salad or yogurt. Nuts are calorically dense, so limit to a small handful per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="often"&gt;Often&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eggs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tofu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dairy products (avoid cheese as there's a lot of fat): yogurts or Skyr, with rolled oats or muesli, and flex seeds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other pulses: chickpeas, green peas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tomatoes: vitamin C and antioxidant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="things-to-eat-rarely"&gt;Things to eat rarely&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White pasta (prefer whole wheat pasta, as it contains less carbs (carbohydrates, &lt;em&gt;glucides&lt;/em&gt;) and a lot more nutrients)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Processed protein sources such as seitan: unhealthy fats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cookings oils (&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/optimize-omega-6-omega-3-ratio"&gt;olive oil is mostly ok though and has other advantages&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="races-2-hours-or-cyclosportive"&gt;Races (&amp;gt; 2 hours, or cyclosportive)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="days-before-2-3-days"&gt;Days before (2-3 days)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/nutrition/do-cyclists-really-need-to-carb-load-before-a-big-ride-284707"&gt;Carb loading&lt;/a&gt;! Porridge, bread, potatoes, rice, pasta. On the night prior to the race, prefer whole wheat pasta as its more nutritious, but in the morning before the race, prefer white pasta, as you'll need more energy and you'll want it available faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="on-the-d-day"&gt;On the D-Day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For breakfast, my go-to recipe is porridge (overnight soaked rolled oats with cow's milk) or muesli mix served with Skyr and a sliced banana, one or two fried eggs, and some white pasta. Make sure to eat at least 3 hours before the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the race, energy bars, gels, some dried fruits and bananas should do. Do drink clean water but also water with added electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replenish your carbohydrates stocks after the race with pasta, but also protein-rich food.&lt;/p&gt;

Let's see how I heal this time...&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Alright alright alright. April the 3rd, 2022, I ran my first official half-marathon, in Berlin. Oh boy was it tough! But I did it. 2 hours and 22 seconds, official time. Not bad, although I must admit I was aiming under 2 hours. But let's blame Strava, as it was giving me the finish line 500 meters shorter. Ha ha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="//romainpellerin.eu/images/half-marathon-2022.jpg" alt="Photo of me running" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Me, about to cross the finish line&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, a race wouldn't be a race without a propre injury, would it? Well, let's be honest, it's not that bad of an injury, but still. I got... "Plantar fasciitis" (in French: &lt;em&gt;aponévrosite plantaire&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;fasciapathie plantaire&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;fasciite plantaire&lt;/em&gt;)! To be fair, it started a week prior to the race. I overtrained (I guess). Indeed, I ran 17 kilometers exactly one week before. The next day the pain came. Not too strong, but strong enough for me to call it a discomfort. I ran the race nonethless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/plantar-fasciitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354846"&gt;random Google search&lt;/a&gt; tells me that it's&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"[...] one of the most common causes of heel pain. It involves inflammation of a thick band of tissue that runs across the bottom of each foot and connects the heel bone to the toes (plantar fascia)."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy enough, I can understand that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the article describes it, you feel the pain mostly in the morning near the heel, right out of bed, and after a few minutes of walking, it starts to fade away, and eventually vanishes, until the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of all the websites that I read (not many in all fairness), the best and easiest treatment is to go easy on exercising for at least a few weeks. I am currently at the end of my first "week off", I'll keep monitoring my pain and see how long it takes to completely heal. I only cycle these days, no more running until the pain is gone. I don't want it to become a chronic pain. Stretching a few times per day is also advised. Wearing a splint at night to hold the whole thing might also be considered. As to me, I'll keep resting for the time being and see how it goes. 🤞&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a simple exercice to do at home to help the healing process: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQmn1sP70PI&amp;amp;t=55"&gt;Exercice maison pour guérir la Fasciite plantaire / Aponévrosite plantaire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="update-2023-03-31"&gt;UPDATE: 2023-03-31&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dang it's been a year!!! So many things happened! First of all, I ran again more than 10 kms for the first time since the half-marathon... 2 days ago 😅. Why? you ask. I'm glad you asked! That thing took forever to heal... more than 9 months. I think last Christmas I could still feel it from time to time. So what happened? July or August last year, I went to the doctor, cause I was still feeling the pain EVERY MORNING. She confirmed my own diagnosis, I have a plantar fasciitis. Good news, in a way. She advises rest (of course), insoles and physiotherapie. Perfect, let's do this! 6 sessions of physiotherapie later, no changes (or very slight but not because of the therapy). The physiotherapist clearly was not seeing many patients with that sort of injury, she did her best to come up with creative exercises but I am pretty sure that did little. Next, insoles. To be honest, I'm not sure how much this helped. I got them in August or September, I would have assumed that if they worked, I should have seen a rapid improvement - that did not happen. Like I said, until Christmas I was feeling moderate/litte plain quite often. Anyway, during that whole year I basically stopped running, or 3 or 4 kms once or twice... lol. Then, since January this yearb, I pretty much never felt the pain again, at least never in the morning. Every once in a while I would feel some tickling in the foot randomly, just as a reminder that something had happened, but no pain per se, and that would only last a few seconds when walking. And now, as I'm writing these lines, I can't remember the last time I felt any kind of pain in this foot because of this injury! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this because you're injured, you're not alone 💪. Give it some time, go easy on running, maybe get insoles, use a massage ball if you have one, do some calf and foot stretching in a staircase, while standing on the edge of a step when facing the stairs (slowly let your heels drop down, repeat a few times). That should do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="update-2023-04-02"&gt;UPDATE: 2023-04-02&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just ran 22 kms today!!! 🎉 No pain, felt great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="update-2023-10-01"&gt;UPDATE: 2023-10-01&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since April, quite a lot happened. First of all, soon after running these 22 kms, I took up running again more consisently. Over the following few weeks, my foot became sore again at times. For very short amounts of time, occasionally, and rarely in the heel but rather random places &lt;strong&gt;in&lt;/strong&gt; the foot. Mild short pain. I've been monitoring this closely. Nothing unbearable at all. It just happens randomly throughout the day, seating or walking, and does not last. On a scale from 0 to 10, it's usually around 2. Let's see how this goes... I just started muscle strengthening in an attempt to fix this for good.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Sports"></category><category term="plantar fasciitis"></category><category term="health"></category><category term="running"></category></entry><entry><title>Shin Splints</title><link href="//romainpellerin.eu/shin-splints.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-06-13T21:30:00+02:00</published><updated>2023-10-01T01:38:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Romain Pellerin</name></author><id>tag:romainpellerin.eu,2021-06-13:/shin-splints.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I got that... and healed.

Cause yeah, I got that following that run, and I could barely walk over the next 10 days, let alone running. So yes, I am kidding, I am no pro runner at all, quite the opposite actually...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="what-the-heck-is-shin-splints"&gt;What the heck is "shin splints"?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/shin-splints/"&gt;This website&lt;/a&gt; says it's "&lt;em&gt;an inflammation of the muscles, tendons, and bone tissue around your tibia&lt;/em&gt;". Basically, a pain around the tibia. It can be as benign as an inflammation, and be as bad as a stress fracture. Fortunately, I had the former form of it (I guess?!). It mostly happens when you're over-exercising (like running twice the distance you had previously run the longest before, on a whim), are under-prepared, when you exercice too often or don't give your body time to rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="how-did-i-heal"&gt;How did I heal?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I had a minor form of it (again, I guess, not sure, I did not see any doctor for that), healing took rather little time. From the day I ran till the day I was not feeling any pain any longer, 10 days went by. The pain started to kick in in the last couple of kilometers, during the run. Then, the first three days I swear I could not walk, I was limping. Oddly enough, casual urban cycling was fine. I am not talking about proper road cycling, but you know, going from A to B in a city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After these 3 first days, some googling and a lot of Youtube searching, I applied ice on my tibia 1 or 2 times a day, for a few days. In addition to that, I lightly wrapped (strapped) my leg in a gym plastic band several hours a day, something similar to a resistance band, so as to keep my flesh tight. Not too much of course, I did not want to block the blood flow. Also I did no running and very little walking on these days. The first two or three days I did not notice any improvement, and then all of a sudden, the pain when walking greatly decreased. It took another 2 or 3 days plus some proper good paced road cycling towards the end of the recovery period, for the pain to finally completely go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am writing here is no medical advise at all, I am just sharing my personal experience. Maybe what I did was good, maybe not, maybe I would have healed faster or slower should I have done things differenlty differently, I have no clue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, as I am writing this, I still have not tried running again, as I injured myself only 20 days ago, but the pain is 100% gone and I walk normaly again. Hopefully the next time I try running I'll be fine... and hopefully you'll find this article helpful. :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Sports"></category><category term="shin splints"></category><category term="health"></category><category term="running"></category></entry><entry><title>Workout</title><link href="//romainpellerin.eu/workout.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-07-06T16:50:00+02:00</published><updated>2023-10-01T01:38:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Romain Pellerin</name></author><id>tag:romainpellerin.eu,2019-07-06:/workout.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Videos&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1 id="how-many-reps"&gt;How many reps?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, to build muscle, one should reach muscle failure after 6 to 12 reps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="how-many-sets"&gt;How many sets?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mensjournal.com/health-fitness/rep-range-builds-most-muscle"&gt;3-6 sets seems to be recommended quite often for hypertrophy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="how-much-rest-time-between-sets"&gt;How much rest time between sets?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard to find reliable data, and it seems there is no consensus. But for hypertrophy, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19691365/"&gt;30-60 seconds&lt;/a&gt; is often cited.&lt;/p&gt;
