&lt;p&gt;Following the recent publication of &lt;a href="https://blog.chriszacharias.com/a-conspiracy-to-kill-ie6"&gt;A Conspiracy To Kill IE6&lt;/a&gt;, we &lt;a href="https://www.doctolib.com/"&gt;at Doctolib&lt;/a&gt; thought we’d in turn unveil our plan to stop supporting not only Internet Explorer 11 but also other outdated desktop browser versions, and help the world move towards a faster and more secure web. Everything that follows took place between March 2019 and July 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late March 2019 Doctolib had over 80,000 paying customers. They are physicians and specialists working in private practices, hospitals, healthcare centers or even at home. They use all kinds of devices and browsers. Some devices are privately owned, some are provided by employers and some are even shared and used by many people throughout the day. As a consequence, it is impossible for us to predict with certainty what browsers our customers will use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, most public healthcare institutions (hospitals, for example) manage their computers like they do in schools or governments. All regular users are not administrators, they only have restricted permissions. They can’t install software or decide which browser they use. Upgrade-wise, their IT departments tend to update the OS and browsers every 1 to 2 years. Privacy is also a much bigger concern for most of them, so they usually favor Firefox over Chrome, and sometimes IE 11 or Edge for compatibility reasons. Last but not least, they’re big on Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR) versions (for a reason, &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/"&gt;it comes with long term support&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of this, here’s what Doctolib’s browser market share looked like in March 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="//romainpellerin.eu/images/supporting-internet-explorer-11-in-2019/browsers-share.png" alt="Historical browser market share for Doctolib customers week by week" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Historical browser market share for Doctolib customers week by week&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graph shows unique browser connections per week. As one can see, Internet Explorer 11 users represent on average between 2.5 and 3.5% of all users. Among our Chrome and Firefox users, some users rely on outdated versions, sometimes more than 4-year-old versions. Same goes for Safari, with pretty stable curves not showing any signs of decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="//romainpellerin.eu/images/supporting-internet-explorer-11-in-2019/safari.png" alt="Historical Safari browser market share for Doctolib customers day by day up until March 2019" /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s the big deal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Cost of supporting old browsers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more browsers a company decides to support, the more problems it brings. At Doctolib, we identified the following specific problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old browsers only understand ECMAScript 5. Like most modern web applications, we have &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; of JavaScript dependencies. Each dependency upgrade must be checked to make sure it doesn’t contain untranspiled code. &lt;strong&gt;That’s time wasted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our app is built with Ruby on Rails and React. Our JavaScript code is bundled in two different ways, depending on the files and where in the app it runs: the &lt;a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html"&gt;RoR asset pipeline&lt;/a&gt; or Webpack. The code processed by the asset pipeline does not go through Babel, as opposed to the one bundled by Webpack. Therefore we can’t write modern JavaScript in all our JavaScript files yet*. &lt;strong&gt;That’s time wasted writing and code reviewing old-fashioned JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt; *(we have a work-in-progress project for using Babel with RoR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our 10,000+ integration tests are executed with the latest version of Chrome. Nonetheless, since we support multiple browsers, we also have a few simple additional integration tests that run on IE11 as well as outdated Edge, Firefox and Safari browsers. These extra tests &lt;strong&gt;cost time&lt;/strong&gt; (developers waiting for CI tests to complete) and &lt;strong&gt;money&lt;/strong&gt; (tests run time on Heroku). &lt;strong&gt;They also require extra maintenance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but far from least, we’ve had several &lt;strong&gt;production issues&lt;/strong&gt; in the last 6 months caused by untranspiled NPM dependencies not working in old browsers. That’s &lt;strong&gt;user dissatisfaction and time wasted for engineers&lt;/strong&gt;. Plus, each production issue is immediately followed by a detailed &lt;strong&gt;postmortem&lt;/strong&gt; which oftentimes means a full day of work for an engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, supporting multiple browsers creates bigger JavaScript bundles because code transpiled through Babel is usually bigger and polyfills take space. It slightly increases compile time, bandwidth consumption, and JavaScript load/parse times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing this, in a perfect world we’d only support the latest version of each browser, Internet Explorer 11 excluded of course. But that is not possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Limitations&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it so hard to have all of our customers upgrade their browsers? Why can’t we just display a banner, or send them an email, threatening to drop support for outdated browsers, and eventually do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there are many good reasons. First, healthcare professionals are generally not computer savvy. Computers are a tool, a means to them, not an end. They don’t want to have to worry about upgrades or browser versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, as written in the introductory paragraph, people working in health establishments have no control over what browser they run. Budget and time constraints prevent these organizations from providing their employees with the latest computers, or prevent them from upgrading software on a regular basis. Also, some organizations are more concerned about privacy than others and thus insist on running specific browsers. Finally, some organizations sometimes use Internet Explorer because they also use other websites which require ActiveX for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are multiple valid reasons for running old and outdated browsers. And multiple reasons for being unable to upgrade regularly. That’s why we can’t just cut off access to these users overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Master Plan (aka Conspiracy)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To kickstart the move towards up-to-date browsers, in March 2019 we came up with a very detailed plan, spanning over several months. When the idea arose for this plan, we were supporting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safari 6+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All Edge browsers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chrome 50+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firefox 27+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internet Explorer 11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal is to support only the following browsers and publicly advertise about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safari 12+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edge 17+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chrome 50+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firefox 45+ (version 45 in an ESR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Internet Explorer version at all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, we want users of unsupported browsers to be fully aware of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did we set this in motion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole plan is based on displaying a banner at the right time, to the right users, progressively over time. The banner explains that the browser is no longer supported and gives links to Chrome or Firefox upgrade help pages. The banner can be hidden for 5 days before appearing again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="//romainpellerin.eu/images/supporting-internet-explorer-11-in-2019/red-banner.png" alt="The top red banner we display on outdated browsers" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The top red banner we display on outdated browsers&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started off with Safari. Why is that? Users who run Safari most likely run Mac and thus use their own device, meaning they’re admin. Public healthcare centers or hospitals never run Apple devices in France or Germany. Plus Safari users are less than 10% of our users, so we thought it’d be quick to have these users upgrade to a newer version of Safari, or switch to Chrome or Firefox. Over the month of April, once or twice a week we increased the minimum supported version of Safari until we reached 12 (the latest stable version at the time of writing). Every few days, a new batch of users would be shown the banner. First, Safari 6 users would see the banner, then three days later Safari 7 users would also, and so on, until all users of Safari 11 or below saw the banner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, we could see the number of users for these unsupported versions significantly decreasing, while seeing Safari 12 slowly but surely rising. It did not work as well as expected though, some users probably don’t care too much about seeing a banner that can be closed anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="//romainpellerin.eu/images/supporting-internet-explorer-11-in-2019/safari-2.png" alt="Usage of unsupported Safari versions among Doctolib customers" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Usage of unsupported Safari versions among Doctolib customers&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we decided to tackle Firefox users. Here, we needed to be extra cautious since users in hospitals are unlikely to be able to upgrade their browsers. Therefore, to avoid impacting user experience, we decided to do it in two phases. First, we repeated what we had done for Safari users with Firefox users not working in hospitals: progressively increasing the minimum supported version until we reached 45. In the meantime, we sent emails to the hospitals, letting them know that in the coming few weeks we’d stop supporting old Firefox browsers. Only then we started showing them the banner, until all Firefox users below version 45 saw it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We repeated this process for Edge and Internet Explorer 11 afterwards. Eventually, when all unsupported browsers had the banner displayed, we decreased the time during which it could be hidden across page refreshes from 5 days to an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All along we closely monitored our usage share of web browsers through dashboards and eventually saw usage of all unwanted browsers go downwards, as we expected them to, although not as fast as we predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, having our customers working in hospitals upgrade their browsers was much harder than we thought. People and organizations need time to adapt. It’s also our mission as a tech company providing an online service to educate our customers and explain why upgrading software is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="center"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Usage of ESR Firefox versions among Doctolib customers&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, we reached all the goals we had in terms of browsers we officially support, even though there is a significant portion of our customers still using unsupported browsers. We’ve already committed to repeat this plan in a few months to try to get rid of Firefox browsers below version 50 and Chrome browsers below 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did this plan teach us? First of all, we can’t force users to upgrade their browsers. We can’t decide what they use. They have constraints of their own and we must take them into account. However, good communication and giving them time brings long lasting relationships and builds trust between us and our customers, which is a requirement if we want them to use the right tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, such an ambitious plan cannot be executed overnight. Internal communication is key and all the relevant departments must be involved as soon as possible, e.g. Customer Service, Account Management, Tech, etc. It works best when everyone is aligned and knows what we are aiming for and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctolib has been growing rapidly over the past 5 years, as has our code base. We have been able to deliver numerous features in a timely manner, but oftentimes at the expense of code legibility and simplicity. The year 2018 was for us an opportunity to step back, learn from our mistakes, and set goals in order for us to regain control over our frontend. Specifically, we re-defined &lt;a href="https://medium.com/doctolib/treating-technical-debt-62630ee64ef7"&gt;technical debt and legacy code&lt;/a&gt; and took measures to reduce it so that we could keep growing at an ever-faster rate and continue to ship features that practitioners and patients love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Identifying pain points&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twice a year a team of people with a strong interest in JavaScript gather to discuss frontend at Doctolib. One person from each feature team is selected to join the meetings. Nevertheless, the meetings are also open to anyone, as long as they express an interest and have proved themselves to be proficient in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In advance of these meetings, we circulate email surveys to all of the software engineers to identify their specific issues and struggles. Below is an extract from the latest survey we sent out in November 2018:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your biggest pain point on the frontend stack?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What elements are holding you back? What prevents you from being more effective?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there anything you don’t understand/you don’t master? RxJS, recompact, react-form? React context, HOC, …?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the directory structure good enough? Does it make sense?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any tool-related problems? (Prettier, IDE, Chrome DevTools)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apart from &lt;code&gt;console.log&lt;/code&gt;, how do you debug?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you know Jest? Do you know how to write JavaScript unit tests?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you know what React components we have? Do you know how to use them and what props they expect?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These simple, short questionnaires allow us to gather valuable feedback from all of the engineers. Using them, we are able to identify the most-cited problems and define what legacy means at Doctolib during our bi-annual meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After analyzing the results of these surveys, we usually come up with a new direction and a list of tasks for the following two quarters. These actions are then shared with the rest of the engineers during an all-hands meeting with the entire tech team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What is legacy code at Doctolib in 2018?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RxJS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Doctolib was in its early stages, state management for React apps was still very experimental and there was no consensus about which way to go. Two emerging libraries were becoming fashionable: Redux and RxJS. The decision was made to pick RxJS, but it could have just as well been Redux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, RxJS usage grew and the library was soon imported into every file and used for just about anything and everything: app state management, tiny component states, forms, buttons, AJAX requests, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is this legacy now?&lt;/strong&gt; Well, first of all, RxJS is not entirely legacy but the way it’s being used at Doctolib is. This is mostly because it has been used for everything, although &lt;a href="https://xgrommx.github.io/rx-book/content/guidelines/when/index.html"&gt;its use cases are normally meant to be very specific and restricted&lt;/a&gt;. RxJS also makes unit testing difficult because Observables need to be mocked-up. &lt;a href="https://xgrommx.github.io/rx-book/content/guidelines/when/index.html"&gt;Reactive programming is not known by many&lt;/a&gt;, as indicated on the graph below, therefore it does not help shorten new joiners’ ramp-up time — quite the opposite, to be honest. Our aim is to restrain its use cases to what it was originally intended to be used for: event-based computations and asynchronous sequences of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="//romainpellerin.eu/images/regaining-control-over-doctolib-com-frontend/rxjs-graph.png" alt="Graph showing RxJS popularity" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;RxJS ranks last among the “other” JavaScript libraries in 2018 &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://2018.stateofjs.com/front-end-frameworks/other-libraries/"&gt;[Source]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Recompose/Recompact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time as RxJS was released, another helper library came out: &lt;a href="https://github.com/acdlite/recompose"&gt;recompose&lt;/a&gt;. As recompose was not meeting all of our needs, the project was forked, patched, and renamed as &lt;a href="https://github.com/neoziro/recompact"&gt;recompact&lt;/a&gt;. Once again, it quickly spread across the code base, bringing Higher Order Components everywhere, as well as additional complexity for new joiners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is this legacy now?&lt;/strong&gt; Most helpers from recompact can be written in vanilla React (recompact.pure or recompact.withProps to name a few). Given that early advocates of recompact at Doctolib left the company a while ago, it became challenging to pass down knowledge and help new joiners get up to speed quickly. Moreover, the original library (recompose) was recently officially &lt;a href="https://github.com/acdlite/recompose#a-note-from-the-author-acdlite-oct-25-2018"&gt;deprecated&lt;/a&gt; because of an upcoming React feature, &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html"&gt;Hooks&lt;/a&gt;, not forgetting that recompose/recompact rely on the legacy React Context API. We now aim at getting rid of recompact altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;jQuery and CoffeeScript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the very beginning, jQuery and CoffeeScript have been lying around in the code base. jQuery helped features come to life in no time, bridging the gap between various browsers, oftentimes with poor support for new Web APIs. As for CoffeeScript, it is tightly coupled with Ruby on Rails, our backend, thus it has been there from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is this legacy now?&lt;/strong&gt; Starting this year, we only support modern browsers and Internet Explorer 11. Consequently, it does not make any sense to use jQuery when we can write plain JavaScript; and CoffeeScript adds unneeded complexity given that very few people can understand it at a glance, let alone write it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;React unsafe life-cycle methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, we recently deprecated a few React life-cycle methods and helpers, following the maintainers’ advice about unsafe methods. &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html"&gt;React.StrictMode was recently introduced&lt;/a&gt; as a tool to help detect potential issues within an app. We cautiously started adding it in the codebase, to avoid having too many warnings popping up here and there while developing. Here is the list of life-cycle methods or helpers we decided to deprecate early in our codebase: &lt;em&gt;componentWillMount&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;componentWillReceiveProps&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;componentWillUpdate&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;findDOMNode&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tackling and killing legacy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After agreeing upon what can be defined as legacy, the time comes to actually kill it. The way frontend legacy is handled at Doctolib is always the same; we pretty much stick to &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@addyosmani/measure-optimize-monitor-33e36108e014"&gt;MOM&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Measure, Optimize and Monitor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measuring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is done by way of our survey and our own experience while developing. While evaluating the relevance of each pain point collected, we prioritize them according to the number of times they are mentioned. We also assess the feasibility over the short-term: short and easy tasks tend to move up on the list of actions. Finally, these actions become Tech Tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optimizing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is done progressively, after our bi-annual meetings, through special tasks we call &lt;strong&gt;Tech Tasks&lt;/strong&gt;. These tasks are differentiated from regular feature tasks by their very own nature: they are purely technical tasks whose goal is to improve platform stability, security, and performance as well as to reduce technical debt. People usually pick the ones they like best when they work on Tech Tasks (Fridays are Tech Tasks days for most feature teams). However, a few big and/or complex tasks do get assigned during our bi-annual meeting in order to make sure that they will eventually be carried out. These big tasks are prioritized by the solution architects and engineering managers on a regular basis to ensure they fit into the roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;monitoring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is done throughout. It is a never-ending process. At the end of every meeting, we set KPIs to “track” and then we immediately create dashboards to track usage of “legacy” through these KPIs. One person is in charge of creating these graphs, usually the same person who called a meeting in the first place. Basically, this translates to metrics we expect to drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="//romainpellerin.eu/images/regaining-control-over-doctolib-com-frontend/recompact.png" alt="Recompact monitoring graphs" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;3 out of the many graphs we use to monitor recompact usage&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three graphs above show the number of lines in our code base containing a deprecated function. This is how we compute these numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rpellerin/6488f5f4bf893a8555a3261ddf2d0856.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also create less-specific dashboards which list the “general” legacy functions and libraries we aim at reducing or killing altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="//romainpellerin.eu/images/regaining-control-over-doctolib-com-frontend/general-legacy.png" alt="Other monitoring graphs" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Everything that is considered legacy is shown on this graph&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These graphs are a helpful starting point from which we can monitor progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preventing people from using it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a long-lasting tradition of heavily relying on static checks at Doctolib. Essentially, they are script files which we run on source code as it is — before transpilation and bundling. Our CI pipeline runs these tests first, before running any of our 8000+ end-to-end tests. Below is the one test which checks for new lines containing deprecated React methods and recompact helpers, and then reports on Pull Requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rpellerin/2521a2dd9e9a0c6cd993755441fffcea.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to relying on static checks, we also regularly inform and remind people about our best practices on the frontend stack. We usually demo state-of-the-art JavaScript once a month, during what we call “Tech Time” — a meeting for and by software engineers. It’s also a good opportunity to show how much progress is being made on reducing legacy code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meeting objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes, the long tasks tend to remain “&lt;em&gt;in progress&lt;/em&gt;” forever and people lose interest in them. This is when the people who first defined these objectives come into play. It is their responsibility to help these tasks reach a conclusion by supporting those working on it and providing a helping hand if need be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, every bi-annual meeting starts off with a review of what has been achieved during the previous term and carries on from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Long-term vision&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deprecating these few React functions, recompact, a significant part of our RxJS usage, jQuery, and CoffeeScript is a major first step. By doing so we can ease new joiners’ onboarding, keep up with the latest JavaScript standards, and reduce our technical debt. It also belongs to a bigger picture. Creating these dashboards opens the door to more monitoring, which ultimately means more control. A recent concrete example is the bundle size dashboard, which we introduced a few weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="//romainpellerin.eu/images/regaining-control-over-doctolib-com-frontend/bundle-sizes.png" alt="Bundle sizes graphs" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;This dashboards tracks our bundles sizes over time&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only does it store the sizes over time but it also reports on Github Pull Requests. &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bundlesize"&gt;A handy npm package called bundlesize&lt;/a&gt; checks that every build does not exceed thresholds defined in our package.json file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="//romainpellerin.eu/images/regaining-control-over-doctolib-com-frontend/github-pr-checks.png" alt="Checks on Github pull requests" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Checks on a Github Pull Request&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to more monitoring, we’ll keep collecting feedback on a regular basis from all of the software engineers, calling for more meetings when needed. We will specifically be paying attention to new joiners, how they feel about the frontend stack and how we can make their onboarding even easier. We don’t want to be held back by legacy code. Instead, we want to be able to experiment with new technologies when relevant, adopt the latest JavaScript standards, and keep up with React.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still much to do on the frontend. A Single-Page-Application is much more than just a website. It’s software that runs in a browser. Hundreds of different browser versions actually, operating at various speeds, with unreliable network connectivity. It has to be as good as any software program. The time when servers were the unique focus point has come and gone; frontend requires a different kind of attention, not less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;General concepts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Observer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: when subscribing, get all past emitted values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Subject&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: when subscribing, get only next-to-come emitted values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;BehaviorSubject&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: like &lt;code&gt;Subject&lt;/code&gt; but keeps a current state, which is the last received value or the one passed to the constructor if none received, then emits it immediately when being subscribed to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;ReplaySubject&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: when subscribing, get all last X emitted values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;AsyncSubject&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: emits the result of an asynchronous operation when the observable completes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Misc&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;shareReplay&lt;/code&gt;: when subscribing, emits the last value. This helps avoid making a new HTTP request for each new subscription, for instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Install&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#basic-github-checkout"&gt;Install rbenv&lt;/a&gt;. In short, here is how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo apt update &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; sudo apt install openssl libicu-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/.rbenv &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; src/configure &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; make -C src
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;export PATH=&amp;quot;$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH&amp;quot;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.zshrc
~/.rbenv/bin/rbenv init
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Open a new shell&lt;/span&gt;
mkdir -p &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;rbenv root&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;/plugins
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;rbenv root&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;/plugins/ruby-build
rbenv install &lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;.5.0
rbenv global &lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;.5.0

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Check everything is installed and correctly set up&lt;/span&gt;
curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/master/bin/rbenv-doctor &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; bash
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then, add must-have stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;gem install bundler

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# In a fresh new Ruby project folder, create a Gemfile&lt;/span&gt;
rbenv &lt;span class="nb"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;.5.0 &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Set version 2.5.0 for this project, same as .nvmrc for Node projects&lt;/span&gt;
bundle init
bundle install --path vendor --binstubs bin &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Set up .bundle config to install packages to the local folder&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Add vendor and .bundle to your .gitignore file&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# In a Ruby project folder, install all dependencies&lt;/span&gt;
bundle install &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# or simply `bundle`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Upgrade Ruby version&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update the version in &lt;code&gt;Gemfile&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.ruby-version&lt;/code&gt;. Then run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; git pull &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; -
rbenv install
gem install bundler
bundle
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Stuff to know&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; is optional&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parentheses optional in &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt;:  &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4467538/what-does-the-operator-do-in-ruby"&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4467538/what-does-the-operator-do-in-ruby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt; (adds new line) vs &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; (no new line)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;.each do |item| ... end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;10.times do |i| ... end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;elsif&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;array = [1,2]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;array[0]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you place a colon in front of a simple word, you get a Ruby symbol: &lt;code&gt;:a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;hash = {a:1,b:2} # creates symbols :a and :b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;hash[:a]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;hash['ok'] = 'yolo' # ok is not a symbol&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement optional, last line is implicitely returned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;func(a,b)&lt;/code&gt; == &lt;code&gt;func a, b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;obj.func&lt;/code&gt; == &lt;code&gt;obj.func()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;def initialize ... end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;@classMemberVariable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;def func&lt;/code&gt; == &lt;code&gt;def func()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;return true if ....&lt;/code&gt; == &lt;code&gt;if ...&amp;lt;line break&amp;gt;return true&amp;lt;line break&amp;gt;end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inheritance: &lt;code&gt;class Child &amp;lt; Mother&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace first occurrence in string: &lt;code&gt;string['word'] = 'new word'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ratings = Hash.new(0)&lt;/code&gt;: all new hashes will default to 0 as their value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;do..end&lt;/code&gt; vs curly braces for blocks in Ruby: &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5587264/do-end-vs-curly-braces-for-blocks-in-ruby"&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5587264/do-end-vs-curly-braces-for-blocks-in-ruby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pry&lt;/code&gt;: pauses execution but does not give access to local variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;binding.pry&lt;/code&gt;: pauses execution, gives access to local variables but also pauses all threads (server and tests for instance)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;whereami&lt;/code&gt; == &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; (in binding.pry / pry) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;help&lt;/code&gt; (get help in binding.pry /pry)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;PRY_RESCUE_RAIL=1 rails test&lt;/code&gt;: runs a test and pauses on falsy assertions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ranges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;x..y&lt;/code&gt; (y included) vs &lt;code&gt;x...y&lt;/code&gt; (y not included)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;assert_equal x,y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since February 2017, I am doing an internship in San Francisco. It is focused on web technologies. I am learning a shit ton of stuff everyday. Thus I'd like to apply all these best practices and use my daily tools on &lt;strong&gt;ONE BIG PROJECT&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This killer project must include the following things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ES7&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web worker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;React (Fiber?) + Redux&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Webpack: &lt;code&gt;create-react-app&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;reselect&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;redux-form&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;React Native as well?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;create-react-native-app&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sequelize: &lt;code&gt;sequelize&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;sequelize-cli&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Express.js + GraphQL (with subscriptions): &lt;code&gt;express-graphql&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apollo or Relay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;dotenv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;jsonwebtoken&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;date-fns&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;storybook&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server-side rendering with Next.js? &lt;code&gt;create-next-app&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;memoizee&lt;/code&gt; for external API calls made by the server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Progressive Web App&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Service worker (makes app available offline)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqi4Xa1ViOQ"&gt;Progressive Web Apps (Cyril Balit - Florian Orpelière)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API"&gt;Notifications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS masks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://tachyons.io/"&gt;Tachyons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing/CI/Production&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;jest-cli&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

May it be full of happiness and lines of code :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's now talk about the new hotness, a JavaScript library getting more and more trendy, with an unceasingly growing community: &lt;a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/"&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;. It's under active development these days, powered by Facebook (and initially created by). Basically, it's meant to build user interfaces in a web context, but recently &lt;a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/"&gt;they also exported it to mobile development&lt;/a&gt;, alloying anyone to write some kind of cross-platform code for both Android and iOS, in JavaScript, just like Appcelerator Titanium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the present time, I'm still getting acquinted with it, but here are a few pieces of advice about how to &lt;a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html"&gt;get started&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;correctly&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://overreacted.io/react-as-a-ui-runtime/"&gt;React as a UI Runtime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How to&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have 2 main tools of choice, to compile it into some browser-compliant package: Webpack or Browserify. I personally decided to go with the former, as it's the most popular and offer more possibilites. Briefly, how to start a new project with webpack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;npm init &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Entry point: index.js&lt;/span&gt;
npm install --save react react-dom babel-preset-react babel-preset-es2015
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# The previous line is required to run React with ES6&lt;/span&gt;
npm install webpack --save-dev
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# --save-dev allow us to add it to the package.json&lt;/span&gt;
npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# To live reload changes in the browser in development&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# MUST NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION&lt;/span&gt;
npm link webpack &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# To make the command available as if it was installed globally&lt;/span&gt;
npm link webpack-dev-server

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Install babel&lt;/span&gt;
npm install babel-loader --save-dev
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# OR, in case of problem&lt;/span&gt;
npm install babel-loader@5.x --save-dev
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Configure webpack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html"&gt;two ways&lt;/a&gt; to pass the configuration object to webpack. However, here we're going to use the CLI way, which uses a conf file. Create &lt;code&gt;webpack.config.js&lt;/code&gt; at the root of the project, containing this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// configuration&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That's all for now. This article is likely to be updated in a near future, stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: a friend of mine also gave a talk last year, at our school, about React. He was an avant-gardist ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;a href="https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns"&gt;date-fns&lt;/a&gt;. It is &lt;a href="https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/issues/275"&gt;lighter&lt;/a&gt; than Moment.js. And it is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/805030922785525760"&gt;immutable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A word on ESlint&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESlint is probably the most popular linter for JavaScript. It is also very convenient and benefits from a large community. That is why I use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started using, I got confused by two different things: &lt;a href="http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs"&gt;shareable configs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-plugins"&gt;plugins&lt;/a&gt;. This &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/eslint/ttZUG3v7vn0"&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; explains the difference between the two quite well. Here is my version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugins are like function definitions (a set of custom rules). Configs are like actual calls to thoses functions (pre-defined configuration of rules - like whether they're enabled or not, and how they are configured).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How to start a new JavaScript project?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is a simple project or a NPM package, I recommend having two distinct folders: &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; for sources and &lt;code&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt; for builds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git init
git add remote origin ... &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# If need be&lt;/span&gt;
npm init
yarn add --dev babel-cli babel-preset-es2015
yarn add --dev eslint
yarn add --dev eslint-config-standard &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
               eslint-plugin-standard &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
               eslint-plugin-promise &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
               eslint-plugin-import &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
               eslint-plugin-node
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;code&gt;babel&lt;/code&gt; to transpile our code, to better support old versions of NodeJS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the last line, the config &lt;a href="https://github.com/feross/eslint-config-standard"&gt;eslint-config-standard&lt;/a&gt; sets the configuration of these four plugins: &lt;code&gt;standard&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;promise&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt;. That is why we need to install them alongside the shareable config. Of course it is a config for &lt;code&gt;eslint&lt;/code&gt;, that is why we installed it on the previous line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;yarn add prettier-eslint-cli
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Normally, &lt;a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier-eslint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;prettier-eslint&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; only operates on strings, not on files. &lt;code&gt;prettier-eslint-cli&lt;/code&gt; will provide you with a command to apply &lt;code&gt;prettier-eslint&lt;/code&gt; on files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is &lt;code&gt;prettier-eslint&lt;/code&gt; meant for?&lt;/strong&gt; Well, under the hood it calls &lt;a href="https://github.com/prettier"&gt;&lt;code&gt;prettier&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (probably the best JavaScript formatter to date) and then &lt;code&gt;eslint --fix&lt;/code&gt; to format your code. Twice. But there's &lt;a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier-eslint#the-problem"&gt;a reason for that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we need to configure &lt;code&gt;eslint&lt;/code&gt; to tell it to use standard as its style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use the standard style with ESlint, create &lt;code&gt;.eslint&lt;/code&gt; in the root directory of your project and write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;{
    &amp;quot;extends&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a badge to your &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;a href="https://badge.fury.io/for/js"&gt;badge.fury.io/for/js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configure &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;...,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;scripts&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;test&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;echo \&amp;quot;Error: no test specified\&amp;quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; exit 1&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;build&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;babel src --presets babel-preset-es2015 --out-dir dist&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;format&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;prettier-eslint \&amp;quot;src/*.js\&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;lint&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;eslint src&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;check&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;npm run lint &amp;amp;&amp;amp; npm run test&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, the only purpose of an API is to give clients (a mobile application, a web site, a software program, a web browser, etc) access to a remote database (thus a server), for storing data (or making complex calculations sometimes).
&lt;strong&gt;The scheme is very simple: the server waits for incoming requests and responds accordingly. On the other hand, clients occasionally send requests, either to perform an action (saving, updating or deleting data), or to retrieve data.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to designing and implementing an (REST) API, you might be seeking a standard to follow (&lt;a href="http://jsonapi.org/"&gt;some people are trying to create a standard&lt;/a&gt;) or some &lt;a href="http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api"&gt;best practices&lt;/a&gt; to apply. You might also wonder which language and which framework to use (don't &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel"&gt;reinvent the wheel&lt;/a&gt; dude!). Actually, there are plenty of them. From the "&lt;em&gt;do it from scratch in Java&lt;/em&gt;" to the "&lt;em&gt;use this all-in-one Javascript framework&lt;/em&gt;", you have a lot of choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've experienced real API development with two languages so far, &lt;strong&gt;Javascript&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Scala&lt;/strong&gt;. With the former, I used the well-known &lt;a href="http://expressjs.com/"&gt;Express framework&lt;/a&gt;. With the latter, I used the equally well known &lt;a href="https://www.playframework.com/"&gt;Play Framework&lt;/a&gt; in its version 2.&lt;br&gt;
I also used &lt;a href="https://github.com/rpellerin/php-mvc-base"&gt;PHP&lt;/a&gt; and Java without any framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's not our purpose in this article. Let's move on to the big question, "&lt;em&gt;How to design an efficient REST API&lt;/em&gt;". Then, we'll have a quick look at &lt;a href="http://expressjs.com/"&gt;Express&lt;/a&gt;, a famous Javascript framework and one of the best for APIs, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I'll try to follow what &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html"&gt;someone once wrote beautifully&lt;/a&gt;, in order to introduce REST APIs, and gradually explain how to improve them. I assume you - the reader - have some knowledge of the HTTP protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/"&gt;It goes without saying that you &lt;strong&gt;must use HTTPS&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure privacy. This way, everything will be encrypted and anyone sniffing the network won't be able to see the content of your requests or responses.&lt;/a&gt; Let's dive into REST APIs now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;You said "&lt;em&gt;REST&lt;/em&gt;"?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In "&lt;em&gt;REST API&lt;/em&gt;", "&lt;em&gt;REST&lt;/em&gt;" stands for "&lt;em&gt;Representational State Transfer&lt;/em&gt;", which is the software architectural style of the web. Basically, this means that any REST API relies on the HTTP protocol (and by extension HTTPS). As a consequence, the first step is to understand all the strengths and weaknesses of HTTP in order to use everything it has to offer. I will only be referring to HTTP version 1.1 in this article, since version 2 is still hardly used overall, and quite badly supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;It's all about resources&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;URLs (&lt;em&gt;Uniform Resource Locator&lt;/em&gt;) represent resources. When designing an API, think about it as resource containers. Every end-point should represent either &lt;strong&gt;a resource&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;a list of resources&lt;/strong&gt;. Following this, there must be &lt;strong&gt;two-end points per resource&lt;/strong&gt;, the resource collection, and an individual resource within the collection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/myresource
/myresource/{id}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If our API is hosted at &lt;a href="https://my-api.com"&gt;https://my-api.com&lt;/a&gt;, then we've just created the end-points &lt;a href="https://my-api.com/myresource"&gt;https://my-api.com/myresource&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://my-api.com/myresource/id"&gt;https://my-api.com/myresource/{id}&lt;/a&gt;. But let's try to avoid abstraction and use real examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are developing a website where registered users can upload pictures. So, we need two end-points for our two entities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/users
/pictures
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Those two end-points will then allow us to get the list of either all the users, or all the pictures. Now, what if we want to know the categories of the pictures? We also need to access individual resources. Let's create other end-points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/users/{id}
/pictures/{id}
/pictures/categories
/pictures/categories/{id}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The important thing here, is to understand that &lt;code&gt;{id}&lt;/code&gt; is a resource's unique identifier. For users, we retrieved these unique identifiers thanks to the &lt;code&gt;/users&lt;/code&gt; end-point (which had given us the list of users). So, &lt;code&gt;/users/{id}&lt;/code&gt; will give us all the details about ONE resource, the targeted user. The same rule applies for any other collection of resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;code&gt;/pictures/categories&lt;/code&gt; represent a list of resources, in our case a list of categories. But this list belongs to a "bigger" resource, a container, &lt;code&gt;/pictures&lt;/code&gt;. It's a &lt;strong&gt;hierarchy&lt;/strong&gt;. This way, we are going to get all the possible categories for any picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let's add a feature: users can send messages to each other. How do we get all the messages sent by a specific user? And a specific message sent by a specific user? Like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/users/{userId}/messages
/users/{userId}/messages/{messageId}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Naming convention&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To remain consistent, try to use the plural form of every word used for your end-points, it will make things easier. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase"&gt;&lt;em&gt;camelCase&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is also a good practice, when necessary (but we always try to use simple single words).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Methods (also called verbs)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest strengths of HTTP is &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html"&gt;its verbs&lt;/a&gt;. The most popular are GET and POST. The latter is mostly used for asynchronous calls (AJAX) or forms in web pages, whereas the former is used every time a page is accessed or reloaded from a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what are the equivalent verbs for our old friend called &lt;em&gt;CRUD&lt;/em&gt; (Create, Read, Update and Delete)? &lt;strong&gt;PUT&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;GET&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;POST&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;DELETE&lt;/strong&gt;. Consequently, any well designed REST API must make use of at least these four verbs. And yes, HTTP has more &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html"&gt;than four verbs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, this is how to create, get, update and delete a specific user:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;POST   /users      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Create&lt;/span&gt;
PUT    /users/&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;id&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Create&lt;/span&gt;
GET    /users/&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;id&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Get&lt;/span&gt;
PUT    /users/&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;id&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Update&lt;/span&gt;
DELETE /users/&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;id&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Delete&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here, the important thing is that &lt;code&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt; is used to create a &lt;strong&gt;specific resource&lt;/strong&gt; (a user), whose identifier has been chosen by the client. Then, the second &lt;code&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt; updates the newly created resource. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; is only dedicated to creating resources&lt;/strong&gt;, unlike &lt;code&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt; that will mostly be used to update, but can also be used to create. When you want to create a resource without specifying its identifier, use &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt;, like in the first line, where a user is signing up (then the API will create an identifier for this user). Logging in would be achieved like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;POST /users/login
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.restapitutorial.com/"&gt;More information about verbs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Understanding HTTP&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I need to add some explanation about the HTTP protocol. Every HTTP transaction (request or response) is made of three main parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An initial line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some headers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The body, separated from the headers by a blank line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For requests, the initial line is made of a verb, a URL and the HTTP version used. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;GET /users HTTP/1.1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, for responses, it's a bit different: the HTTP version, a response status code and an English reason phrase describing the status code, like in the following example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A typical simple request would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;POST /users/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: my-api.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

name=Jon&amp;amp;lastName=Snow
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And a (non-related) response (I chose a random header):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Expires: Thu, 24 Sep 2015 19:36:25 GMT

Hello world
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That said, let’s get back to APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous sections we learned the correct use of the HTTP verbs, so now let's talk about the body and the status code. Headers will come later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Transmitting data&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can a client update a user on the server? What if someone wants to update their biography for example? Or wants to mention their age? Likewise, how does the server respond and send data back to clients? Here come the status codes and the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, clients need to send &lt;strong&gt;one type of information&lt;/strong&gt; in the body: data to be put into the remote database, via a &lt;strong&gt;PUT&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;POST&lt;/strong&gt; request. It can be either to create a new resource or to update it (it depends on the HTTP verb used).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the server can send different types of information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Via the status code:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the request was handled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In headers:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metadata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the body:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A resource&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;a list of resources&lt;/strong&gt;, in response to a &lt;strong&gt;GET&lt;/strong&gt; request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some details about a resource&lt;/strong&gt; newly created, in response to a &lt;strong&gt;PUT&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;POST&lt;/strong&gt; request. For example, the resource's unique identifier or URL, to access this resource.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the body is only dedicated to the requested resources(s). That's all. All other useful information &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be transmitted via the HTTP status code or headers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The status code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to tell the client the resource has been created? Use the code 201. Want to say something went wrong? 500. Forbidden? 403. Resource not found? 404. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes"&gt;Choose the right one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the most used status codes for an API:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Status code&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Used in response to&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;200 OK&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;GET&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;201 Created&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;PUT (when creating a resource), POST&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;202 Accepted&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;PUT, POST&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;204 No Content&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;PUT, DELETE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;301 Moved Permanently&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;GET, PUT, POST&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;400 Bad request&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Any&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;401 Unauthorized&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Any&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;403 Forbidden&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Any&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;404 Not Found&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;GET, PUT (when updating), DELETE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;500 Internal Server Error&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Any&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HTTP protocol is very flexible, allowing us to use any non existing code if needed and relevant, when none of them fits our needs. For example, the range 550-599 can be used freely, the way you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/whhD1.png"&gt;Need help in choosing the correct status code?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The body&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sending parameters, from HTML forms, is pretty easy, it's a key-value thing, where parameters are separated by "&amp;amp;", like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;firstName=Jon&amp;amp;lastName=Snow
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here, there's no recommended convention. I used camelCase (as shown above) without any particular reason. Choose one and be consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, out of the context of HTML forms, how to format the body? Well, one could say we could use the same key-value format, but actually, it's not a good idea. Let's see what options we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A historic battle: XML vs. JSON or SOAP vs. REST&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have two main options: XML or JSON. Nowadays, a lot of people use JSON. I won't try to defend JSON here, please &lt;a href="http://www.json.org/xml.html"&gt;read this comparison&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.json.org/"&gt;the official description&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To briefly sum it up, JSON brings efficiency, lightness and high-readability in a single format. Additionally, it's extremely easy to parse with any language, thanks to a great integration and a lot of support. It’s definitely the most popular format when dealing with APIs. You can easily create a single object or an array of objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just keep in mind that JSON is probably your best ally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A particular header&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier on, we saw that the second part of every HTTP request is the headers section. Let me introduce one of them, probably the most important one: &lt;code&gt;Content-Type&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its only purpose is to specify what kind of data we are sending. Consequently, in our case, this header should be like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Content-Type: application/json
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Basically, its value is just a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type"&gt;MIME type&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Real world example&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;POST&lt;/strong&gt; request sent by the client:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;POST /users HTTP/1.1
Host: my-api.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
    &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Jon Snow&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;bad_guys_killed&amp;quot;: 200,
    &amp;quot;skills&amp;quot;:
        [
            {&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Warrior&amp;quot;},
            {&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Member of the Night&amp;#39;s Watch&amp;quot;}
        ],
    &amp;quot;is_a_badass&amp;quot;: true
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Basically, its value is just a MIME type. To such a request, the response the server would send back:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{
    &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: 123
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We can see that the server created the resource (thanks to the status code). It also gives us its ID, JSON-formatted. Then, we can do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;GET /users/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: my-api.com
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We would get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: 123,
    &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Jon Snow&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;bad_guys_killed&amp;quot;: 200,
    &amp;quot;skills&amp;quot;:
        [
            {&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Warrior&amp;quot;},
            {&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Member of the Night&amp;#39;s Watch&amp;quot;}
        ],
    &amp;quot;is_a_badass&amp;quot;: true,
    &amp;quot;created_at&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;2015-09-02T17:05:22.996Z&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;updated_at&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;2015-09-02T17:05:22.996Z&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, our API is able to do the four basic operations we needed (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete"&gt;CRUD&lt;/a&gt;, remember?), on any kind of entity, easily, thanks to a pretty format, JSON. End-points are semantic and hierarchically ordered. Everything is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;
&lt;img src="//romainpellerin.eu/images/api-unicorn.gif" alt="A gif showing a unicorn" style="width: 150px; height: auto" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But... (there's always a &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't take advantage of all the strengths of HTTP. Headers, you remember? And what if we want to apply some filters to our &lt;strong&gt;GET&lt;/strong&gt; requests? Sorting? What about pagination? Getting your 1M users in a single response body isn't a good idea, trust me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, what about security? Authentication? But first, let's talk about HATEOAS...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://putaindecode.fr/posts/api/hateoas/"&gt;HATEOAS, the Holy Grail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, to access a specific resource, you need to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the list of resources, e.g. &lt;code&gt;GET /users&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the unique identifier of the targeted resource in this list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Construct its URL, often https://&amp;lt;domain&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;list-of-resources&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;, e.g. &lt;code&gt;https://my-api.com/users/123&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, do &lt;code&gt;GET /users/123&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another approach would be providing directly every resource's URL in the list (among other links if necessary), like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;[
    {
        &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: 123,
        name: &amp;quot;Jon Snow&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;links&amp;quot;:
            [
                {
                    &amp;quot;rel&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;self&amp;quot;,
                    &amp;quot;href&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;https://my-api.com/users/123&amp;quot;
                },
                {
                    &amp;quot;ref&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;list&amp;quot;,
                    &amp;quot;href&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;https://my-api.com/users&amp;quot;
                }
            ],
        &amp;quot;bad_guys_killed&amp;quot;: 200,
        ...
    },
    {
        &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: 124,
        ...
    }
]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Instead of providing the full URL, you might as well only provide the path name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot;links&amp;quot;:
    [
        {
            &amp;quot;rel&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;self&amp;quot;,
            &amp;quot;href&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;/users/123&amp;quot;
        },
        ...
    ]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm not a huge fan of HATEOAS. I believe that an API should be consistent in its manner of accessing resources. I like to assume that, as soon as I know a resource's unique identifier, I can access it by constructing its URL, as I explained above. So, I don't need the links, I can construct them by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But I'm wrong&lt;/strong&gt;. This is definitely the best way to do. It adds a layer of abstraction. If one day you change the way to access a resource (not with a unique identifier anymore, but with a token, or an email address, or anything), if you always provided the link for each resource, the change would be transparent for your users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Headers are metadata&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great thing to consider is that the body &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; only contain the requested resource(s). Any other piece of information must go to the headers. Furthermore, you can create any header you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Authentication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two major concepts under the name of &lt;em&gt;authentication&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign up/Log in/Log out: &lt;strong&gt;user management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authorization: &lt;strong&gt;restricting the access to the API&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User management can be be achieved with cookies. This way, you can restrict some end-points to logged in users only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel, you might want to restrict the entire API to specific clients. One could say "&lt;em&gt;Use basic authentication&lt;/em&gt;", but that doesn't really fit our need since it's not the original purpose of basic auth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you can do instead is quite easy: create as many HTTP headers as you want and send (secret) keys on every request. For example, let's create a key to make sure we're accessing the right app, and another one to define the access level granted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;POST /users HTTP/1.1
Host: my-api.com
Content-Type: application/json
Security-APP-ID: 123456
Security-Access-Level: 3

{
    &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Jon Snow&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Obviously, as I said in the beginning of this article, all of this doesn't make sense at all if you don't use HTTPS (and force it!). You really don't want to expose such keys to anyone on the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://restcookbook.com/Basics/loggingin/"&gt;More information about authentication&lt;/a&gt; and about &lt;a href="http://blog.slaks.net/2015-10-13/web-authentication-arms-race-a-tale-of-two-security-experts/"&gt;security in general&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Location&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another useful header is &lt;code&gt;Location&lt;/code&gt;. A good practice is to use it after creating a resource with &lt;strong&gt;POST&lt;/strong&gt;, to give back the location of the resource newly created. This way, no body is needed and your API can respond with a status code &lt;em&gt;201 Created&lt;/em&gt;, without a body. For example, after creating the user &lt;em&gt;Jon Snow&lt;/em&gt;, we would get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: https://my-api.com/users/123
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The protocol and domain are optional, we could just send &lt;code&gt;/users/123&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other useful piece of information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, you can create as many custom headers as you want. A good practice with end-points returning a list of resources, is to give the total number of records in the database when relevant, via a header. You may wonder why, since we can programmatically count the number of results. But, as I will explain it in the next section, you are never going to return the full list of results in a single response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this is an example of a header specifying the number of rows. The request:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;GET /users HTTP/1.1
Host: my-api.com
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Total-Rows: 7897

[
    {
        id: 1,
        ...
    },
    ...
]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Pagination&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When returning a list of resources&lt;/strong&gt;, above a certain number or results, you should split your response in pages. It's a good practice for reducing waiting time and the weight of responses. Moreover, you might not need the whole list at once. Depending on the amount of details provided for each resource, a general rule would be returning between 100 and 1000 results per request as a maximum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requesting a page is as simple as providing a query parameter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;GET /users?page=3
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On the server side, you would just skip the &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;number-of-results-per-page&amp;gt;*&amp;lt;number-of-page&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt; first users. Pages start at 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you return 100 users per request, with page 0 you would skip no one and simply returns the first 100 users (from 0 to 99). On page 1, you skip the first 100 users from your database and return the users from 100 to 199, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's a problem...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say you have 10 users in your database. Every &lt;code&gt;GET /users&lt;/code&gt; returns 3 users at most, sorted by age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In SQL, this would be something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;users&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;ORDER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;AGE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;LIMIT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;OFFSET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* where x equals 3*&amp;lt;number of page&amp;gt; */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You'll then have 3 pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Page 0&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Page 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Page 2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;45,&lt;/strong&gt; Jon, 20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;55,&lt;/strong&gt; Alice, 30&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;99,&lt;/strong&gt; Pete, 37&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;87,&lt;/strong&gt; Laura, 23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9,&lt;/strong&gt; Bob, 33&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1,&lt;/strong&gt; Cindy, 39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3,&lt;/strong&gt; Jean, 25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2,&lt;/strong&gt; Helen, 36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;78,&lt;/strong&gt; Max, 40&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a scenario:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET /users?page=0&lt;/code&gt;: fine, you get results from Jon (id 45) to Jean (id 3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new user (Mary) signs up on your website/mobile application, aged of 24.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET /users?page=1&lt;/code&gt;: you get results from Jean to Bob. You got the same person twice (Jean), this is a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happened?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mary is 24 and the API returns results sorted by age, Mary would be returned on page 0, which shifts Jean to page 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good way to solve this problem is to create a pagination based on an entity (here, a user). Instead of requesting a particular page, you would say to the API "&lt;em&gt;give me results after this user&lt;/em&gt;" or "&lt;em&gt;before this user&lt;/em&gt;". Let me explain it by replaying our scenario:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET /users&lt;/code&gt;: no pagination specified, fine, you get results from Jon (id 45) to Jean (id 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new user (Mary) signs up on your website/mobile application, aged of 24.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET /users?pageAfter=3&lt;/code&gt;: since the last person of our previous results had an id of 3, we request the users &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; that ID. This way, we make sure we won't get duplicated results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, you can either write a more complex SQL query of simply do the pagination programmatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem that still remains is that, by doing this, we have no way to retrieve Mary, except if we request page 0 again, by doing this, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;GET /users?pageBefore=3
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Two last things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always enable pagination, even if your entire collection is small and will never grow. Like this, you API's users won't get lost. The API remains consistent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a page returns this entire collection, use the status code 200. Otherwise, use the status code 206 (&lt;em&gt;Partial Content&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://metabates.com/2012/02/22/adding-pagination-to-an-api/"&gt;More information about pagination&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Filtering and sorting&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every end-point that returns a list of resource should allow filtering on fields, as well as sorting. The following request should be possible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;GET /users?country=US&amp;amp;age=21&amp;amp;sortBy=name
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We request all the users from the US, aged of 21, sorted by name. The inner mechanism is up to the developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're done! Now, you know how to build efficient and robust APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building an efficient API involves many aspects to consider, and most of all, requires a good knowledge of HTTP. It's time-consuming at first sight, but once you know what you're doing, what your needs are in terms of features, it's pretty straightforward. Considering all aspects right at the beginning, like security or the database architecture and how you would like to expose it, is key. That's what is called designing an architecture, and one should pay heed to it. When properly and carefully done, the API implementation job is fairly easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the next steps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Add a documentation for other developers who use your API&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://apidocjs.com/"&gt;apidoc&lt;/a&gt; (I really like this one, very easy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://swagger.io/"&gt;Swagger.io&lt;/a&gt; (good reputation, altough I never tried it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/@orliesaurus/a-review-of-all-most-common-api-editors-6a720dc4f4e6"&gt;A full list of most common API editors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Going further: create a CLI&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make you API public! Create a documentation and a NPM package to ease the work for developers. &lt;a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/blog/features/2015/09/21/Public-API-available/"&gt;Read how Clever Cloud did it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cliparse"&gt;cliparse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Quick example with Express.js&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://expressjs.com/"&gt;Express&lt;/a&gt; ease the process of developing APIs with Javascript so much! You should definitely give it a try!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;npm init
npm install -g express &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Globally, to be able to use the CLI of express&lt;/span&gt;
npm install -S express &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Locally, added as a dependency&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here is how to define a little API with Express (I only wrote the most important lines). Every controller defines many functions to handle the end-points (storing data into the database, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, the access to all the end-points is restricted, with a &lt;a href="http://expressjs.com/guide/using-middleware.html"&gt;middleware&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;code&gt;auth&lt;/code&gt;. The clients need to provide specific headers in order to perfom actions with the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;express&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Controllers&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;usersController&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;cloud/controllers/users.js&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;categoriesController&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;cloud/controllers/category.js&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Configuration&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;cloud/functions/security&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;methodOverride&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Allow PUT and DELETE&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/*** API ***/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Users&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/users&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;             &lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;usersController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/users/:id&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;usersController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/users&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;usersController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;signup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/users/login&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;usersController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;put&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/users/:id&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;usersController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;edit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/users/:id&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;usersController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// In case of failure&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Some logging&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Let it beee&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That's it! With only a few lines, you can easily get a working API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is now the end of this article, hope it will help you! Any feedback appreciated ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a little recap of everything above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;End-points represent either an individual resource or a collection of resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use HTTPS verbs: &lt;strong&gt;GET&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;PUT&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;POST&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;DELETE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use HTTP status codes (those already existing or yours)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use JSON&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The body must only contain the requested information. It can be either:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A resource or partial details about a resource&lt;/strong&gt; (JSON object)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A list of resources&lt;/strong&gt; (JSON array): also provide full link with each resource (&lt;a href="https://my-api/users/123"&gt;https://my-api/users/123&lt;/a&gt; for example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metadata must be put inside headers&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of rows when returning a list of results (added by the server)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secret keys for authentication/restricting access to the API (added by the client)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cookies for user management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;code&gt;Location&lt;/code&gt; header (with the status code &lt;em&gt;201 Created&lt;/em&gt;, but without a body) after creating a resource with &lt;strong&gt;POST&lt;/strong&gt;, to give the resource's link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use query parameters&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filtering: &lt;code&gt;GET /users?country=US&amp;amp;age=21&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sorting: &lt;code&gt;GET /users?sortBy=name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pagination: &lt;code&gt;GET /users?pageAfter=3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always enable pagination on any collection, even for the small ones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pagination must be based on "&lt;em&gt;after a resource's identifier&lt;/em&gt;" or "&lt;em&gt;before a resource's identifier&lt;/em&gt;" to avoid duplicate content across pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the status code 200 when the entire collection fits in one page, otherwise 206&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Going further&lt;/h1&gt;

In the last couple of months, we, at &lt;a href="http://www.wearesmiths.com/"&gt;The Smiths&lt;/a&gt;, tried to define our workflow more formally by integrating continuous integration. How to properly "synchronize" a team made of many developers, "spread all around the world", in different time zones? How to make sure there is no bottleneck at any level, during the development? First, let’s have a look at the definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is &lt;strong&gt;continuous integration&lt;/strong&gt;? According to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, it's:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[...] the practice, in software engineering, of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not only. It's much more than this. Let's dive into continuous integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Purpose&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous integration is an entire concept that tries to ease software development by making things much easier and more flexible. Like agile methodology, it's been getting more and more popular since the beginning of the 2000's. Nowadays, it tends to be widely adopted in any kind of software company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Effortless automation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous integration is mostly about automation. By this, I mean being able to deploy flawlessly, many times a day. Like &lt;a href="//romainpellerin.eu/i-want-to-be-a-more-efficient-developer.html"&gt;Quentin Adam&lt;/a&gt; is used to saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/waxzce/status/639078610230476800"&gt;Hosting has to become a commodity.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same applies for documentation generation, testing and deploying. Repetitive tasks are most of the time painful and should be performed by computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Continuous testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every new release should be tested.&lt;/strong&gt; Automatically. Without any human intervention. In a safe and minimal environment, not a human's environment with tons of programs, custom environment variables, outdated dependencies, etc. It's a human job to design the tests but running and validating them is a machine job. This way, the results can be shared with an entire team over automatic emails and archived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writting documentation is for humans. Generating it is for machines. Again, it's a repetitive task that no one should be assigned. It's a waste of time. Machines can do it instead of us, at the right time, usually when a new release is about to come out. Furthermore, machines don't forget to bump the version numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deploying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With continuous integration, deploying should be as simple as a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tim_LHUILLIER/status/396652013716770816"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When time has come for deployment, no one has to use &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;rcp&lt;/code&gt;, not even &lt;code&gt;ftp&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;It's unsafe insofar as it's too much of a risk to let a human get inside a production machine.&lt;/strong&gt; A developer has nothing to do in a production machine, as long as all the tests have been passed before pushing to production. All one can do is breaking something. A production machine is meant to be administrated by a sysadmin, no one else. Once it's set up, the only action required by developers is pushing code when it's ready to go live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the same story for releases. Packaging and releasing a new version &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be a simple task anyone can do, not only the CTO, regardless of the OS, configuration, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I exposed the principles of &lt;strong&gt;continuous integration&lt;/strong&gt;, the question you may want to ask is "Yes, but why?". Indeed, prior to continuous integration, everything was already working well, more or less. So, you might wonder how anyone can benefit from continuous integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, continuous integration should simply be regarded as an entire development workflow. It enables your team of developers (or even a single developer) to be more agile. You can easily get rid of god-awful tasks without actually deleting them, just by delegating them to computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel, you can improve maintainability and evolutivity of the software produced by adopting the right versioning and bug tracking tools. How? Let's take an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember in the old days, when you used to package your code into a zip file and name it according to the version? How boring it was to keep all of those files. Was it easy to track differences between two given versions? How could you determine the changes? How could you apply hotfixes on an old (but still in use) version as well as on the latest one? How could you know which developer had written which feature? Here come the version control systems, or more simply, Git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example. For every new version (and sometimes between two) you had to set up your environment correctly, generate the documentation from source code, bump the version number in both code and documentation, run unit/integration/system tests and finally, if everything goes well, compile it for &lt;strong&gt;as many platforms as you support&lt;/strong&gt; (which quite often would mean a lot), and make it available on a website (or somewhere else). Well, how pleasant would it be if &lt;strong&gt;all of this&lt;/strong&gt; could be achieved right after a &lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's now see how to get started with continuous integration, easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you might have understood that you &lt;strong&gt;have to use Git&lt;/strong&gt;. And if you stil don't know why, you read read my article &lt;a href="//romainpellerin.eu/git.html"&gt;about Git&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the most important thing with continuous integration is... your Git workflow. You have to remain consistent from the beginning of a project to its end. Everyone involved has to be careful and focused at each step. Working within a big team is not something easy. Everyone has different schedules, information doesn't spread that well. That's why having a robust and error-proof Git workflow matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At The Smiths, we identified &lt;strong&gt;four main components&lt;/strong&gt; that we wanted as &lt;strong&gt;core parts of our Continuous Integration process&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Semantic versioning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Git workflow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Travis-ci.org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agile methodology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Semantic versioning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to stick to the very simple rules proposed by &lt;a href="http://semver.org/"&gt;semver.org&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, it says that a version number should be something like &lt;em&gt;MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH&lt;/em&gt;, where (what follows has been extracted from their website):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sticking to this rule forced us to think more about the logic behind the versions, reshape road maps more precisely, and allowed us to bump our version numbers more cleverly. We applied this to our mobile apps and Titanium widgets, bumping version numbers carefully over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Successful Git Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part is clearly the most important, as it’s being used every single day by everyone. In general, it’s likely the most important aspect about continuous integration, to which we had paid a lot of attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some research, we came across a very popular Git workflow, the branching model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Git workflow" src="//romainpellerin.eu/images/continuous-integration-git-workflow.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This picture has been taken from &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/"&gt;A successful Git branching model, by Vincent Driessen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nvie/status/644601079985008640"&gt;thanks to him&lt;/a&gt;). Overall, it’s the best Git workflow we’ve ever encountered. &lt;strong&gt;So we adopted it, with some specificities: we made a few minor changes to that original branching workflow, in order to better suit our needs.&lt;/strong&gt; It can be applied to any kind of software project. I also need to mention that we use GitHub, the most famous web-based Git repository hosting service, because it offers some great features, such as Pull requests, a bug tracker (issues), etc. Moreover, as most of our code has been open sourced (except our clients’ core apps), it’s not a problem at all. By the way, it also gives us a greater visibility, it’s like giving away our widgets to the Titanium community thanks to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let's move onto &lt;strong&gt;our workflow&lt;/strong&gt; that we daily use, with Github:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Our Git workflow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a remote repository called &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt;. Then, every new developer (including the owner) has to fork this repository. The &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt; repo will &lt;strong&gt;ONLY&lt;/strong&gt; contains two branches: &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;: contains &lt;strong&gt;only the stable realeases&lt;/strong&gt; (General Availability), tagged with&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git tag -a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Those are production releases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt;: contains &lt;strong&gt;only stable code&lt;/strong&gt; with newly developed features. This branch has been created with&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git checkout -b develop master&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It’s the latest cutting-edge release (Release Candidate). It may contains some bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No one is allowed to commit into &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; nor into &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; (except for the first commit into &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; is forked from &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;), in either &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt; or the forked repository. Not even locally!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's &lt;strong&gt;one developer responsible for the entire project&lt;/strong&gt;. Let's call him/her &lt;em&gt;Integrator&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To add a new feature, one of the developers create a local branch called &lt;code&gt;feature-x&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; and commit into it. He/she may push this branch to their own forked repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When this feature is fully developed and tested, and ready to go into &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt;, the developer creates a &lt;em&gt;Pull request&lt;/em&gt; from the forked repository to &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt; (from branch &lt;code&gt;feature-x&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt;). Then, &lt;strong&gt;only one person can accept it and merge it: &lt;em&gt;Integrator&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; He/she can also refuses it and comment about the reason(s).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the &lt;em&gt;Pull request&lt;/em&gt; has been accepted, everyone has to update their &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; branch (locally and on their forked repo).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The same applies for hotfixes: anyone can create branches called &lt;code&gt;hotfix-y&lt;/code&gt; and create &lt;em&gt;Pull requests&lt;/em&gt; from them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When time has come for a new release, &lt;em&gt;Integrator&lt;/em&gt; merges back &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; and tags it with a release number (according to the Semantic versioning). Then, anyone update their &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone is strongly encouraged to rebase on top of &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; as often as possible, especially before submitting PRs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you're working alone on a project, no need to fork anything. Just apply the same principles to the only remote repository (&lt;em&gt;Pull requests&lt;/em&gt;, merge, etc). You can skip &lt;em&gt;Pull requests&lt;/em&gt; if you want so, it just helps keeping a trace of every new feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've found out that this workflow works pretty well with any of our projects, might it be an entire app or a mere widget. However, as I said we've made some adjustments to the original workflow found on the Internet, making it a bit simpler to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issues&lt;/strong&gt; are also great features brought by GitHub that allow us to track down bugs and list them. One can assign people to fix an issue, and let others know of its progression thanks to emails or notifications. Issues can also be linked to specific commits which helps a lot when tracking regression bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we're also taking advantage of &lt;strong&gt;Milestones&lt;/strong&gt;, a GitHub feature, which can be seen as a simplified scheduler, permitting us to create deadlines with goals to reach. It's somehow a list of deadlines with progress bars automatically filled as we would create and merge Pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Some commands&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To generate the message for a Pull request:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git log --pretty&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;oneline --abbrev-commit &amp;lt;branch-from&amp;gt;..&amp;lt;current-branch&amp;gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Prints the commits you made since last merge and the associated messages&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To update &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; (works with &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; as well):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git fetch origin
git checkout develop
git merge --ff-only origin/develop
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Only fast forward is important to keep the history clear and clean&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To update a feature branch (after a PR has been merged):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git fetch origin
git checkout feature-x
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Three options (choose only one):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 1.&lt;/span&gt;
git merge --ff-only origin/develop
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 2. If this fails because you have commits ahead, do:&lt;/span&gt;
git rebase origin/develop
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 3. If you&amp;#39;re a badass and want to ignore your own changes:&lt;/span&gt;
git reset --hard origin/develop
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To merge a &lt;em&gt;Pull request&lt;/em&gt; (only &lt;strong&gt;Ingrator&lt;/strong&gt; is supposed to do it) and push it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git remote add feature-x_repo git@github.com:someone/forked-repo.git
git fetch feature-x_repo feature-x
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feature-x_repo/feature-x &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# You could add --no-commit to edit files before committing&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# &amp;#39;no fast forward&amp;#39; is important to keep the history clear and clean&lt;/span&gt;
git push origin develop
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To delete a branch (locally and remotely) once it has been merged into the main repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git push feature-x_repo --delete feature-x
git branch -d feature-x
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Contributors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's another approach to the scheme above. Instead of using only &lt;em&gt;Pull requests&lt;/em&gt;, you could add other developers as &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors/"&gt;contributors&lt;/a&gt;. This way, there's no Mr/Ms &lt;strong&gt;Integrator&lt;/strong&gt;, any contributor is free to merge their features into &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt;. Also, feature branches can be on the remote repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Git branching model considered harmful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Git workflow we used as a starting point (the branching model) has been considered harmful &lt;a href="https://barro.github.io/2016/02/a-succesful-git-branching-model-considered-harmful/"&gt;by someone, and thus that person proposed another model&lt;/a&gt;. The reading is worthwhile although I'm still not fully convinced by this alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org/"&gt;Travis&lt;/a&gt;, the all-in-one tool&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, Travis will be your best friend. But first, what is Travis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, it's an online service delivered through a website, providing sets of virtual machines started especially for a developer whenever needed. Those machines run some scripts and shut down themselves automatically. Usually, a developer sets up their Travis account to run scripts on every &lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt; performed on a GitHub repository. However, one can configure Travis to be run with any kind of Git hook. &lt;strong&gt;Travis is free&lt;/strong&gt; but they also have paid services with much more features (that we didn't require).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how is Travis so helpful for us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Most common use cases of Travis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, one can imagine dozens of scenarios. Documentation generated from the source on every new &lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt;? Easy. Running a whole set of tests automatically? Easy as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's dream a bit further... One of the most fancy things one can do is &lt;strong&gt;running a set of tests, bump version numbers in the code and the documentation, compiling the software program and generating the updated documentation, pushing the binaries to Amazon S3 and the documentation to GitHub Pages, and making the whole set available to everyone, automatically!&lt;/strong&gt; And yes, Travis, can push into specific branches as well. That might be really useful to update web pages automatically (a link to the latest stable release, listed on a download page, for instance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is definitely the most perfect and automated scenario one could imagine, but that's easily achievable, although it would take quite a long time to set it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;An example with Github Pages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good example is my blog (yes, the one you're reading). My articles are written in Markdown and contained in the branch &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;. However, what you're reading, is a &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;Github page&lt;/a&gt; (contained in a branch called &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt;). What is happening hunder the hood is that, every time I push on &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;, Travis fetches it, generates the HTML pages from the Markdown files, and pushes them to the branch &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; on Github. This way, my blog gets updated automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed &lt;a href="http://blog.mathieu-leplatre.info/publish-your-pelican-blog-on-github-pages-via-travis-ci.html"&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt; to do that (and &lt;a href="http://fle.github.io/lectures/pelican-github-2014.html"&gt;this presentation&lt;/a&gt; as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How does it work&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the root of your repo, just add a &lt;em&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/em&gt; with some pieces of configuration inside. And you're done! A few more options are available on their web interface as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can have a look at &lt;a href="https://github.com/rpellerin/blog/blob/master/.travis.yml"&gt;my .travis.yml for this blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tips with Travis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens"&gt;Get a new token from Github&lt;/a&gt; in order to give Travis access to your repo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In travis, disable &lt;em&gt;Build on Pull requests&lt;/em&gt;, enable only if .travis.yml is present&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Agile methodology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, agile methodology. Behind that term that sounds rather complex is a concept pretty simple. In Computer Science, we use the term "Agile Software Development". Wikipedia says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Agile Software Development is a set of software development methods in which requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also an official Agile Manifesto that tries to describe it more precisely, based on twelve principles. &lt;strong&gt;From that original manifesto have appeared dozens of practices that we refer to as "Agile methods"&lt;/strong&gt;. I won't explain them here as it is not the purpose, for more information visit the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development"&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one we picked is called &lt;strong&gt;Scrum&lt;/strong&gt;. Again, I won't explain it here but will instead expose the workflow we adopted, derived from it. For a better comprehension, I recommend you read the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)"&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, at the very beginning of the project, the CTO would meet client and discuss with them. As a result, he would obtain detailed specifications from them. Then, all together, we would brainstorm and define Milestones, which are fundamentally the most important steps to a final product. For instance, from scratch, we would aim at developing a MVP (which is a working product, see the picture below), then progressively add features, grouping features under Milestones. As a reminder, "Milestones" is a feature of GitHub. Each Milestone would last a week, tops. In Scrum, Milestones are called &lt;em&gt;Sprints&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with an MVP is the right way to go. The client is always satisfied as they would get a working copy of the product being-developed, at each stage, continuously getting improved. They would not have to wait for weeks or months before being able to test anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="MVP" src="//romainpellerin.eu/images/continuous-integration-mvp.png"&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Courtesy of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/henrikkniberg/status/685474589539983360"&gt;Henrik Kniberg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, each developer would get assigned or choose a few features from the first Milestone until completion. Every morning, we would gather for a 10-minute stand-up meeting, during which everyone would say what they did the previous day and what is left to do, especially regarding the current day. Standing forces us to speak concisely and don't waste each other's time, since it is not as comfortable as being sat down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the Milestone's week, we would merge all the Pull requests resulting from the features, then review all together all the work done, conduct tests and create issues on GitHub to be resolved before starting the next Milestone. Eventually, we would readjust the remaining Milestones when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would go on until completion of the final Milestone, which is supposed to bring all the features originally requested by the client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="SCRUM" src="//romainpellerin.eu/images/continuous-integration-scrum.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the part "Bug fixing" would require extra-time. In such a case, we would extend that part onto the next week, only assigning one person, so that the rest of the team could stick strictly to the rule "a Milestone per week". But that rarely happened fortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mix them all&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a brief conclusion, when thinking back at all the parts of our workflow, one can see that it's an entire whole in which GitHub plays a key-role. Being organized, knowing everyone's role and keeping in mind goals to reach are important as well, just like the tools we decided to go with. Furthermore, being able to release intermediate versions, quickly, allowed us to give constant feedback to the client, which is reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workflow is surely perfectible, but until now it has proved really efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I hope this article was helpful. It's a good start with Continuous Integration. First, focus on your workflow (especially with Git) and then set up the right tools (including Travis) and you're good!&lt;/p&gt;

Here is how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I need to learn a programming language quickly, or just recall it, I often use a few tips, very simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Data Types&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also known as primitive data types. Data types are the very basis of every programming language. Knowing them allow you to manipulate variables, arrays, functions, etc. Generally, there are less than 10 of them. For example, Java has the following primitive data types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;short&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;long&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;double&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; could also be considered as a primitive data type since it doesn't require the keyword &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; to be instanciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Keywords&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we're on the subject, keywords (also called "reserved words") are another excellent way to quickly recall a programming language. Here again, they are not so numerous, generally around 50. Here are some keywords in Java:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;abstract&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;continue&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Those words are reserved and used by the compiler, that's why you can't use them as variable names for example. Consequently, they give you a pretty clear overview of what you can do with each language. Furthermore, if you've already learnt that language, you'll then quickly remember what each keyword means. Then, just iterate through those keywords and in less than 5 minutes, you'll remember everything about this language!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The main function&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each language has its own approach. Here are some of them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Java&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;C&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;argc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;argv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Python&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="vm"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;__main__&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Don't forget to know this function!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Have a look at some of your previous projects... or code&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving a quick look at projects helps a lot! Try to look at the basics: inherited classes, overloaded and overriding functions, asbstract classes, IO functions, etc. If you have time, try to code some of them again!&lt;/p&gt;
